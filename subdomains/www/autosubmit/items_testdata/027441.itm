body^Reverend William E. Lori, of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, told Congress that contraception is no more essential to women than a ham sandwich.  The number one priority for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops this year is to impose their religious beliefs on American women by challenging birth control coverage in the new health care law.  Sign our petition today—speak out for the separation of church and state. It's time the Bishops heard from you.  The demands of a few religious leaders cannot trump the health of millions of women.  To date, Catholic dioceses across the country and other Catholic and evangelical organizations have filed over twenty lawsuits against the no-copay birth control benefit.   It's a good thing our Constitution says religious institutions don't get to write the rules.  Catholic hospitals employ nearly 800,000 people nationwide. Religious schools employ another 300,000. Approximately 1.7 million students attend the nation's 900 religiously affiliated colleges. Add up the number of these groups and you can see why it's so critical to stop this blatant overreach of the Catholic Church into the private lives of Americans.

fullbody^Reverend William E. Lori, spokesman for the U.S. Conference ofCatholic Bishops, recently argued before Congress that contraception is no more essential to women than a ham sandwich.Is he qualified to dictate the health care needs of millions of American women?Please don't be silent. Sign our petition to the Catholic Bishopstoday—speak out for the separation of church and state.What's the number one priority for the U.S. Conference of CatholicBishops this year?To impose their religious beliefs on American women by challengingbirth control coverage in the new health care law.The Center for Reproductive Rights has been fighting this blatantdisregard for the separation of church and state—but we think it'stime the Bishops heard from you.Speak out for women across America by signing our petition to CardinalTimothy Dolan—the head of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.Tell him that the demands of a few religious leaders cannot trump thehealth of millions of women.To date, Catholic dioceses across the country and other Catholic andevangelical organizations have filed over twenty lawsuits against theno-copay birth control benefit. The Catholic Bishops (along withextremist politicians in many states) think nearly any employer shouldbe allowed to invoke religious liberty as a way to override and denywomen access to preventive health care. It's a good thing ourConstitution says religious institutions don't get to write the rules.And while opponents of contraception try to say their fight isn'tagainst women or contraception. We say, yes it is—and they're willingto cross the constitutional line that separates church and state inorder to win it.Karen, the Catholic Bishops have gone too far and we need you to speakout right now.Catholic hospitals employ nearly 800,000 people nationwide. Religiousschools employ another 300,000. Approximately 1.7 million studentsattend the nation's 900 religiously affiliated colleges. Add up thenumber of these groups and you can see why it's so critical to stopthis blatant overreach of the Catholic Church into the private livesof Americans.We cannot sit idly by while the Catholic Bishops trample on ourconstitutional rights. Please don't be silent—take action today.
