fullbody^A controversy is churning over projections for sea-level rise through
the end of this century and whether they should be used in drafting
development policies along the coast today.

Draft legislation circulating among state lawmakers, lobbyists and
advocacy groups would prohibit state and local government agencies
from using projections of accelerated sea rise - due mainly to global
warming and the melting of polar ice caps - when forming coasting
development policies and regulations.

If enacted as written, the measure would require rates of sea-level
rise to be determined using historical data "limited to the time
period following the year 1900," but not "scenarios of accelerated
rates of sea level rise."

It is a response to a controversial 2010 report by the N.C. Coastal
Resources Commission's Science Panel on Coastal Hazards, which
recommended that a sea-level rise of 39 inches, or 1 meter, be adopted
as the amount of anticipated rise by the year 2100 for policy
development and planning purposes. The report noted that there is
consensus among scientists that the rate of rise will increase this
century and beyond.

The legislation, in effect, would ensure the findings of the report
aren't reflected in coastal management policies.

Rep. Pat McElraft, R-Carteret, who is pushing the proposal, said she
wants to ensure that historical data, not projections, are used when
estimating sea-level rise. She said she doesn't believe the estimates
from the science panel's report.

"It's a guess," she said.

Coastal controversy

Also among its backers is NC-20, a nonprofit economic development
organization funded largely by local governments on the coast.

Tom Thompson, NC-20 chairman, has called attempts to estimate
sea-level rise based on assumptions of global warming a "fool's
errand." He rebutted the science panel's findings, pointing to studies
by other scientists that suggest the rate is actually decelerating.

Thompson said NC-20's main concern is ensuring an "economic
catastrophe" doesn't occur in coastal communities as a result of
"speculation" about accelerated rise. A 39-inch projection, Thompson
said, would put roughly 2,000 square miles near the coast in flood
zones. There, he said, properties would have difficulty being sold,
financed, insured or used productively.

Everything would have to be elevated to accommodate the projections,
which could lead to higher construction costs. That, in turn, would
impact funding for other projects.

He said roads built using the 39-inch standard would become "de facto
dams," which could cause flooding problems on neighboring properties.

"The problem in this case is the economic impact is huge," Thompson
said. "We can't afford to be wrong.... We're talking millions and
millions of dollars."

But Todd Miller, executive director of the N.C. Coastal Federation,
said it isn't wise to rely on historical sea-level rise data alone and
ignore science that global warming will speed up the rise. "These days
if you don't anticipate future trends, they'll swamp you," Miller
wrote in his blog on the Coastal Federation website. "Just look at
what happened to Kodak and Polaroid."

Opponents of the legislation also argue that major science
organizations, including the National Academy of Sciences, agree that
sea-level rise will accelerate, and that North Carolina would be
bucking a trend among other states that are planning for an
accelerated rise.

Said McElraft of the other states: "Shame on them for doing that to
their citizens on science that has not been proven."

Local views conflict

The Business Alliance for a Sound Economy, which represents the
interests of homebuilders and developers in the Wilmington area,
opposes the use of accelerated sea-level-rise as a planning benchmark.
In comments about the proposal, BASE officials said it could affect
residential and commercial construction, piers, docks, public
infrastructure and other projects.

Cameron Moore, a BASE lobbyist, said any sea-level rise policies would
be added to land-use plans and used to draft rules and regulations for
anyone seeking permits to build along the coast.

"It's called a policy, but in the end of the day, it's a rule. It's a
regulation we would have to abide by," Moore said.

But critics of the measure say the bill would impact long-range
planning decisions for municipalities, such as how and where to build
sewer treatment plants, roads and other infrastructure with longer
lifespans.

Erin Wynia, a lobbyist for the N.C. League of Municipalities, said
league members are watching closely.

She said municipalities need the ability to preserve local
decision-making because they must make decisions today about public
infrastructure projects.

"These types of decisions are best made at the local level," she said.

Phil Prete, senior environmental planner with the city of Wilmington,
also weighed in with concerns about the proposal, according to an
email. As the largest city along the coast, Wilmington has been a
leader in exploring responses to sea-level rise, he wrote.

"(The science panel) recommendations are based on science, and this
legislation proposes to prevent us from taking advantage of that
science for policy and planning," he wrote.

He deemed the measure a "broad-reaching restriction."

As of Thursday, the proposal hadn't been heard by any General Assembly
committee, and it was unclear when it would be heard or whether it
would be modified from its draft form.

McElraft said Thursday that she believed sea-level rise legislation
would be considered this session, but she didn't know if her bill
would be the vehicle for it.
