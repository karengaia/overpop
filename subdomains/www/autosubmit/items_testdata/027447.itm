fullbody^The first-ever African Human Development Report, released today in Nairobi, begins with a paradox: Sub-Saharan Africa is home to some of the world's fastest growing economies and most lush agricultural land, but it is also home to the largest group of hungry, undernourished and malnourished people on Earth. One in four people living in the region is undernourished. In each of two regions - the Sahel of Western Africa and the Horn of East Africa - 15 million people don't have enough to eat. As UN Development Program Administrator Helen Clark said at the report's launch, "Impressive GDP growth rates in Africa have not translated into the elimination of hunger and malnutrition.""Towards a Food Secure Future," a report of nearly 200 pages, attempts to explain how hunger has persisted in an otherwise up-and-coming region. Historical legacies, bad policies, decades of inattention to agriculture, and massive inequality are just a few of the factors holding back access to nutrition across the continent. In other words, the problems are structural - built into the very food systems that are now broken. Fixing them, the report argues, will take a combination of technological, political and social interventions. "History is not destiny," the report's preface argues. "Africans are not fated to starve—provided that governments move decisively to put in place appropriate policies and support mechanisms." The story of how Africa became the world's least food secure region begins half a century ago. Newly independent governments, encouraged by development institutions and former colonial powers in the West, focused on industrial development—often at the expense of agriculture. Early disinvestment in farming was followed, in the 1970s and 1980s, by so-called "structural adjustment"—fiscal regimes that massively reduced state spending and trimmed bureaucracies. The combination meant that even as food supplies dwindled, social safety nets to help the needy or food insecure ceased to exist. The legacies of these policies continue to plague the organization of agriculture in Africa today, the report argues. Cereal yields in Sub-Saharan Africa have essentially stagnated since the 1960s, and what little gains the region have seen have come from increasing the amount of land in use rather than improving efficiency. Land tenure laws are also in shambles in many places, and a mixed web of taxes and subsidies plague food production at all stages. Meanwhile, dilapidated infrastructure, poor market access and a lack of storage and transport capacity all deter farmers from investing in growing larger or more profitable crops. The report acknowledges that breaking these patterns will not be easy—"[it] will require courageous citizens and dedicated leaders." But certainly, the need could hardly be more pressing. On current trends, the growth of 40 percent of children under age five in Sub-Saharan Africa will be stunted—roughly the same percentage as today. The world average is half that. And hunger rates are merely the most visible symptom of flawed food systems. The percentage of the labor force in Sub-Saharan Africa that works in agriculture is often above 50 percent. In countries such as Rwanda, Burundi and Burkina Faso, it surpasses 90 percent. Falling yields and poor market access hurt these citizens' bottom lines, entrenching poverty. Meanwhile, high food prices—inflated by the heavy cost of transporting to markets on poor roads—mean that in countries from Cameroon to Kenya to Malawi, households spend well above half their income each month on food.All these structural factors and vulnerabilities stand to come to a head in coming years as Africa's population continues to expand. By 2050, the UN estimates that the continental population will reach 2 billion. Several years earlier, half the population will reside in urban areas, making them increasingly reliant on food markets.The report is not pessimistic, however; rather, it poses these challenges as a combined opportunity that—if taken—could transform the countries of the region. "Connecting three assets—a bulging youth population, advances in innovation and the promise of agricultural development—is a natural way forward for many countries," the report argues.The first mechanism the report suggests is improving agricultural productivity—something that has failed to take place in Sub-Saharan Africa for almost five consecutive decades. Big gains can come from re-investing in agriculture after years of decline. That means focusing on technological innovations in new seeds, better and more ecological tactics—and the vital extension services to insure that those tactics get used. Small interventions can often make a big difference: Numerous initiatives are being tried throughout Africa to send farmers information about market prices and selling opportunities.Equally important, the report argues, are low-cost innovations to provide better nutrition to populations. Nutrient-rich foods are one option. Emphasis should also be placed, the authors argue, on diversity: Unlike modern diets in the West, for example, many diets in the region rely on just one or two food groups. These previous two interventions are not new; for the last decade, African governments and the broader international community have announced similar goals. What might set this report apart, however, is its simultaneous emphasis on social justice. Empowering women, reducing inequality and ensuring human rights aren't just ethically important; they'll also improve food systems, the report argues. Take women, for example, who make up approximately half of agricultural laborers in the region but possess a relatively small share of land—the least, in fact, of any region on earth. "When women…gain a voice in the decisions affecting their lives and livelihoods, their capacity to produce, trade, and use food is materially enhanced," the report concludes. Social safety nets are also vital during the transition toward food security to prevent the poor from slipping through the cracks. Food aid, the report says, still has a place, but it should draw its supplies from local markets whenever possible, relying on international supplies only when food is actually in short supply. A long road lies ahead, but if Africa's recent economic progress is an indication, there is incredible potential for growth. It can't come soon enough as pressures—demographic, economic and even climactic—weigh on the region. The report proclaims, "Higher agricultural productivity can deliver a triple dividend—sustained food security, higher human development and lower pressure on land and water."Read the full report here: http://www.afhdr.org
