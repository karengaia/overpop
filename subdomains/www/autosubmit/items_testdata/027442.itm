body^Population Action International believes the U.S. should lead international efforts to meet the demand for family planning by appropriating $1 billion annually, which is the U.S. fair share of the $6.7 billion investment needed to meet international family planning goals, and would accelerate progress on the U.N. Millennium Development Goals.

Americans spent nearly $51 billion on pets in 2011, and 8 billion on cosmetics and another 17 billion dollars on cosmetic procedures like botox in 2010 despite a deep recession. 

Defense spending is budgeted at $680 billion in 2010.  Hence in one day the Pentagon spends nearly $2 billion which would fund a lot of annual family planning and motivational soap operas.

Those who object to funding international family planning must think it is much better to let them breed poverty, misery and terrorism and then kill them with drones apparently.

fullbody^From the site that produced the film Weathering the Change.

PAI believes the U.S. should lead international efforts to meet the demand for family planning by appropriating $1 billion annually. The $1 billion figure is the U.S.' fair share of the $6.7 billion investment needed to meet international family planning goals, and would accelerate progress on the U.N. Millennium Development Goals.

I recently came across the amount Americans spend on pets - nearly $51 billion in 2011.

maybe $1 billion on family planning? 

We spent 8 billion on cosmetics and another 17 billion dollars on cosmetic procedures like botox in 2010 despite a deep recession.  In 1998, the 225 world's top richest individuals earned a trillion dollars whereas the bottom 2.5 billion people earned a trillion dollars.  Interesting world isn't it?

Defense spending is budgeted at $680 billion in 2010.  Hence in one day the Pentagon spends nearly $2 billion which would fund a lot of annual family planning and motivational soap operas wouldn't it?  Much better to let them breed poverty, misery and terrorism and then kill them with drones apparently.
