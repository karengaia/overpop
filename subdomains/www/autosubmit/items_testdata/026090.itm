fullbody^BLOG: Abortion and the Missing 160 Million Date: Wednesday, June 29, 2011 Source: The New York Times Author: Ross DouthatResponding to my column?s claim (pegged to Mara Hvistendahl?s remarkable new book) that the spread of sex-selective abortion places pro-choice liberals in an uncomfortable situation, Matt Yglesias suggests that abortion isn?t really the issue here, and asks that we imagine a world in which sex selection takes place at the contraceptive stage, through the use of a ?boy pill? or ?girl pill?:On joint Douthatian and Yglesian principles, nobody?s being killed here. But I think that if we found out that use of the ?boy? pill was extremely widespread, this might still legitimately worry us for three kinds of reasons. One is that widespread use of the boy pill would express the inegalitarian idea that men are more valuable than women. A second is that widespread use of the boy pill would reflect the existence of ongoing inequities in society that make it the case that a male child is more valuable than a female child. The third is that there are plausible reasons to believe that even a relatively small gender gap in the population could have problematic macro-scale consequences for society.As it happens, sex-selective medical intervention overwhelmingly takes the form of abortions. But there are plenty of reasons you might be concerned about the phenomenon that don?t have to do with abortion specifically.But I wasn?t suggesting that pro-choice liberals have no reason to be ?concerned about the phenomenon? of 160 million missing girls. (I would hope that they?re concerned!) My point was that the story of sex-selective abortion creates more difficulties ? both intellectually and, I would submit, emotionally ? for abortion-rights supporters than it does for those of us on the pro-life side of the argument.Related Links: http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/28/abortion-and-the-missing-160-mi llion/ Click here for full text
