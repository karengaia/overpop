OP-ED: Make Birth Control Affordable Date: Tuesday, July 19, 2011
Source: The NEw York Times
Author: Vanessa Cullins

MY daughter, a divorced mother of three, called me recently to
complain about the high cost of birth control. As a physician, I'm
familiar with this problem, yet it never fails to frustrate me. Our
health care system could save billions -- and improve the health of
women and families -- by placing birth control within every woman's
reach. Instead, health insurers continue to charge fees that make it
difficult, sometimes impossible, for women to prevent unintended
pregnancy.

Believe it or not, my daughter is one of the lucky ones. She works for
a health insurance company, and her own coverage includes preventive
reproductive health services. Unfortunately, her plan has a $1,500
deductible and her contraceptive of choice -- an IUD -- requires an
up-front payment of $1,200. Lacking that kind of money, she opts for
contraceptive injections, which last only a few months but are less
costly in the short run.

Millions of American women share my daughter's struggle. Fortunately,
they may soon get a break. In a report due out this week, the
Institute of Medicine will review a range of women's health services
and will advise the federal government on which ones should qualify as
preventive health care under the Affordable Care Act signed last year.
If the institute defines birth control as prevention -- and the
government accepts its advice -- women will no longer have to pay
deductibles or make co-payments for birth control. The Department of
Health and Human Services is expected to decide the matter in August.

The change is overdue. Cost often determines whether a woman is able
to choose and maintain her most appropriate method of birth control,
especially during hard times. One in three women voters have struggled
to pay for prescription birth control at some point, and have used it
inconsistently as a result, a survey commissioned by Planned
Parenthood found last year. That's one reason our country has such
high rates of unintended pregnancy and abortion.

Nearly half of all pregnancies in the United States are unplanned, but
affordable contraception can change that. One study found that as the
proportion of unmarried women at risk of unintended pregnancy who used
contraceptives increased -- to 86 percent in 2002 from 80 percent in
1982 -- the abortion rate for the same group fell, to 34 per 1,000
women in 2000 from 50 per 1,000 in 1981.

More affordable contraceptives would also improve health. A 2008
literature review found that women with unintended pregnancies were
less likely to receive timely prenatal care, putting infants at
greater risk of low birth weight and health problems, and in some
cases resulting in more costly deliveries.

Last but not least, easier access to contraceptives would save
taxpayers money. Compared with their peers, teenage mothers are less
likely to graduate from high school or attain an equivalency diploma;
they also make less money and require more federal aid.

When the federal government offered full coverage of birth control to
all federal employees in 1998, it experienced no increase in costs. In
fact, by some estimates it costs employers more not to provide
contraceptive coverage in employee health plans.

Today's system of co-payments and deductibles for birth control
compromises the health of families, wastes money and sends a terrible
message to women like my daughter: when it comes to planning your
family, you're on your own. It's time to change that.

No Safe Place for Somali Women Refugees in Kenya Date: Saturday, July 16, 2=
011
Source: Voice of America
Author: Gabe Joselow

In the maternity ward at a hospital on the Hagadera refugee camp in
Dadaab, Kenya, women refugees lay on beds nursing newborns or waiting
to give birth.

Katlum Mohammed, 22-years-old, has just arrived at the camp from
central Somalia. She lays on her side, nine months pregnant with her
first child.

For her, this has not been an easy journey. She said her husband died
in the fighting between government forces and al-Shabab. ?He was not
part of any group,? she says, ?he was a civilian. I have undergone a
lot, and my way here was so tiring.?

And while walking to the border in Kenya, she and the others in a
group of six were robbed, again, by Al-Shabaab.

Her story is unfortunately not unusual.

The maternity clinic here, run by the International Rescue Committee,
has seen a steep rise in pregnant refugees since June, as a worsening
drought in East Africa forced many to flee.

Before the sudden influx, doctors at the clinic say they were
delivering about 40 babies a week. Now it is twice that.

And while the health care is good for now, most new arrivals are
unable to find space in the overcrowded camps, so they are pushed to
the lawless outskirts.

Birth Control Without Copays Could Become Mandatory Date: Tuesday, July 19,=
 2011
Source: NPR
Author: Julie Rovner

Is there nothing in last year's Affordable Care Act that people won't
fight over?

The latest battle is set to come to a head Wednesday, when the
independent Institute of Medicine is expected to make recommendations
about preventive health care services for women. And one service
that's drawing a lot of the attentions is contraception.

Depending on the group's recommendation, contraception could become
part of a package of preventive benefits that every health plan would
have to cover without patient cost-sharing. In other words, it would
become effectively free.

That would have made a big difference for Andrea Leyva, of Tucson,
Ariz. A few years ago, following the cancer death of one of her three
children, she and her husband ? both employed and with health
insurance ? were nonetheless struggling to pay the bills for them and
their remaining two children.

The $25 copay for her monthly birth control prescription "began to
fall into the category of a luxury for us," she said, and they stopped
filling the prescriptions regularly. At age 36, Leyva found herself
pregnant with what she calls her "blessed surprise," daughter
Alexandria. "So while we're happy that she's here, it was not planned,
and had we had some better finances, we probably could have made some
better decisions," Leyva says now.

Deborah Nucatola, senior director for medical services for Planned
Parenthood Federation of America, says Leyva's story isn't unique.
"Half of all pregnancies that happen in the U.S. every year are
unintended," she says. "And if we could prevent an epidemic of this
proportion, that should be justification enough that contraception is
preventive care."

But at the same time, says Nucatola, who's also an OB-GYN, birth
control is about more than just preventing pregnancy. "We can also use
it as essential preventive medicine for the 4 million women who have
babies every year in the U.S.," she says. "Babies born at least 18
months apart are going to be healthier than those born closer
together, and closely timed births are risky for their mothers, too."

Debate Boils Over African-American Abortions Date: Monday, July 18, 2011
Source: NPR - All Things Considered
Author: Michel Martin

MICHEL MARTIN, host: I'm Michel Martin and this is TELL ME MORE from NPR Ne=
ws.

Coming up, my thoughts about rushing to judgment. That's my Can I Just
Tell You? commentary and I'll have that in just a few minutes.

But, first, it's time to go behind closed doors. That's the part of
the program where we talk about issues that are often kept private,
often because of stigma or shame. Today we want to talk about a very
sensitive subject. It's about abortion, but within the
African-American community. In recent months, several anti-abortion
advocacy groups have placed billboards in major cities around the
country, decrying the abortion rate among African-Americans.

The placards feature provocative slogans such as: The 13th Amendment
freed us. Abortion enslaves us. Or: Every 21 minutes, our next
possible leader is aborted. And that features a picture of President
Obama. The data does show that abortion is more prevalent in the
African-American community than among other groups.

While black women make up about 13 percent of the U.S. female
population, they account for 30 percent of abortions performed in the
U.S. That according to the Guttmacher Institute. That's a nonpartisan
research group that tracks information about reproductive health
issues. Though several of these racially targeted anti-abortion
campaigns are supported or led by African-Americans, they've also
outraged many people, both African-American and not.

To talk more about this, we've invited Ryan Bomberger. He's co-founder
and the chief creative officer of the Radiance Foundation. His
organization created several of these controversial billboards as part
of their Too Many Aborted campaign.

Today, the group plans to release a new series of videos calling out
black leaders for not supporting the pro-life movement. And Mr.
Bomberger joins us from Georgia Public Broadcasting in Atlanta. Mr.
Bomberger, thanks for joining us.

RYAN BOMBERGER: It's great to be able to be a part of the conversation.

MARTIN: Also with us for additional perspective is the Reverend
Carlton Veazey. He is president and CEO of the Religious Coalition of
Reproductive Choice. And he is joining us from member station WBEZ in
Chicago. Reverend Veazey, welcome to you. Thank you so much for
joining us.

The Reverend CARLTON VEAZEY: Thank you, Michel.

MARTIN: So, Ryan, what gave you the idea for this campaign?

BOMBERGER: Well, this really was started as part of the Radiance
Foundation's effort to emphasize the beauty of individual purpose. And
so we launched the TooManyAborted.com campaign as to highlight the
disproportionate impact of abortion in the black community where the
abortion rate is five times that of the majority population.

So we looked at the historical context of abortion and the statistical
context. And looked at the decimation that it's causing in the black
community. So it really stems from my own life story of adoption. I'm
adopted in a family of 15. I'm also an adoptive father. And so we want
to look at life affirming alternatives to the destruction that
abortion brings.

MARTIN: Why focus on calling out - your latest campaign to call out
African-American leaders for supporting reproductive choice, as
opposed to, some might say a more positive message of encouraging
women who find themselves in crisis pregnancies to give them other
alternatives?

BOMBERGER: We do. I mean, that's part of these pro-life, pro-adoption
themed billboard campaigns. We do emphasize the beautiful
life-affirming option of adoption. And the problem is it doesn't
matter what the pro-life messaging is, it is always going to be
denounced by pro-abortion groups who use the euphemisms of a
reproductive choice.

We're talking about abortion. We need to talk about the reality of
what it truly is. It's like calling slavery economic justice. So we
look at the actual status, the federal stats, and we look at why
abortion is occurring in the black community at the rate that it is.
And it all ties to historical initiative launched by Planned
Parenthood that has never ended. The Negro Project back in 1939.

MARTIN: You believe, just to clarify this, and also I should mention
that these billboards - the initial billboards we're talking about
were taken down July 10th. Apparently that's when your contract ended.
Although there are some protesters who believe that their efforts led
to the billboards being taken down. But you believe that groups like
Planned Parenthood target African-Americans. Explain why you think
that.

BOMBERGER: Well, the irrefutable historically documented proof that
the Negro Project launched by Planned Parenthood's founder Margaret
Sanger - that's an historical event. There was never...

MARTIN: No, I'm sorry, I don't think that there's - I don't know that
there's, I mean, it is true that there were projects aimed at
encouraging contraceptive use among African-Americans, but I don't
know that there's any data to show that abortion was a part of that
conversation. In fact, there's also documented evidence...

BOMBERGER: That's not what I was saying.

MARTIN: ...that Margaret Sanger abhorred abortion herself.

BOMBERGER: I'm not saying about abortion. Birth control, to severely
reduce or eliminate the reproduction of poor blacks. The Margaret
Sanger papers out of NYU prove this point.

MARTIN: But you think contraception is the same as abortion?

BOMBERGER: Contraception - abortion has become today's contraception.
There was never any Caucasian project or Latino project or Asian
project. There was only the Negro Project to reduce the birthrate of
poor blacks. That's an important point because what they have done,
instead of looking at the actual substantive issue, looking at the
history, looking at today's statistics and the continued targeting,
they don't engage in the conversation at all. And I think it's a shame
because abortion affects all of us. It's not just a women's issue,
it's a human issue that profoundly impacts all of us.

MARTIN: OK.

BOMBERGER: And to not allow the conversation, I think, is a tragedy
especially for the black community.

MARTIN: All right. Let's hear from Reverend Veazey on this point.
Reverend Veazey, what is your view of this campaign? Mr. Bomberger
says that he just wants to focus on a particular group where abortion
is, in fact, more prevalent. What's your response to this?

VEAZEY: First of all, I think Mr. Bomberger does not understand that
when you talk about black community and saying that Planned Parenthood
places clinics in those areas, you got to understand also that Planned
Parenthood also they are not involved just in the clinic in terms of
providing procedure, they also deal with STDs, they deal with cancer
screening, they deal with other health issues. And these clinics are
placed in the poverty-stricken areas where they can be of more help to
black women and black young people.

So I think he's using that as a ploy. Black leaders deplore what he is
doing and what the foundation is doing. There are reasons for that
statistic. I won't even go into the statistic. But I will say that one
of the things that you have to understand in terms of statistics is
that these are unintended pregnancies. And why is that? Because of
lack of health care, lack of the opportunity to provide adequate
contraception.

These are the reasons why that statistic may be high. I come from the
South and this is very important. I come from Memphis, Tennessee. I
was raised during the '40s. I don't know Mr. Bomberger's age, but
raised during the '30s and '40s and I know what it was like for poor
women and black women. They had back-alley abortions. They suffered
from gross infection and hemorrhages and died in alleys.

And I think, this is my personal opinion, I think that this foundation
and all those associated with this issue, the grand strategy is simply
to create the groundswell so that when this issue comes before the
court, they can get a reverse on Roe v. Wade.

MARTIN: If you're just joining us, this is TELL ME MORE from NPR News.

We're talking about anti-abortion efforts aimed at the
African-American community. I'm speaking with the Reverend Carlton
Veazey. That's who was speaking just now. He's president and CEO of
the Religious Coalition of Reproductive Choice. Also with us, Ryan
Bomberger. He's co-founder of the anti-abortion group, the Radiance
Foundation, which recently mounted a series of billboards aimed at
African-American women encouraging them not to have abortions. And is
also now releasing a series of videos aimed at African-American
leaders, encouraging them to embrace pro-life efforts.

Mr. Bomberger, what about that? Is that the ultimate goal, is to make
abortion illegal?

BOMBERGER: Well, ultimately, yes. I mean, just like the abolishment of
slavery, which was a goal because of the dehumanization of blacks, the
same is the abolishment of abortion because another class of people
are considered less than human. And, you know, I can appreciate you
growing up in the South and you should be able to appreciate the
eugenics-based laws like Jim Crow laws and the anti-miscegenation laws
that existed - are the same policies that influenced the entire
beginnings of Planned Parenthood.

VEAZEY: Absolutely not.

BOMBERGER: And the birth control project, the Negro Project, and the
continued targeting that happens today under the guise...

VEAZEY: Could I speak to that?

MARTIN: Sure. I hear you. Reverend Veazey, you certainly can. Reverend
Veazey, you certainly can. But let me ask Mr. Bomberger to answer the
other question and the other point that you made. Reverend Veazey's
point is that African-American women are more likely to have abortions
because they are less likely to have access to health care. And what
about that? What about his point?

BOMBERGER: Right. Let's actually make sure we're talking about the
same thing. Talk about reproductive health care, not health care. How
is it that the same people that can find these clinics to have an
abortion can't find the same clinics for contraception? There are over
1,700 clinics around the United States that provide the same
reproductive health care as Planned Parenthood. They just don't abort
children.

MARTIN: You just don't agree with the idea that people have abortions
because they don't have viable other alternatives - is that your - you
just don't buy that.

BOMBERGER: I think offering death as a solution to any social ill is a
really poor approach. If we applied that to any other social ill
facing the black community, it's not about lack of access. Hispanics
have far less insurance than blacks. Thirty-seven percent are
uninsured versus 19 percent of blacks. Yet Hispanics have a far lower
abortion rate. Their poverty level is on par with that of blacks.

VEAZEY: All right.

BOMBERGER: And they have far less abortions.

VEAZEY: OK.

BOMBERGER: Lack of access is a myth.

MARTIN: All right. Reverend Veazey?

VEAZEY: Yeah. The point I want to make, first of all, he keeps talking
about this as a moral issue. It is a moral issue and women are moral
agents. And women have the ability to make the decision about their
lives. And this is a decision based on their moral agency. Our first
mission statement, when we organized almost 39 years ago, 38 years
ago, was to ensure women's right to determine when or whether to have
children according to her own conscience and religious beliefs without
governmental interference. And that remains our mission today. And
they are moral agents.

So don't think that it's just moral on your side, it's moral on our
side. If a woman makes a decision based on her moral agency that this
is best for her, who are you to determine that?

MARTIN: Let me, finally, this is obviously an important topic and
we're not going to resolve the differences, which is not indeed our
role. I thank you both so much for having this spirited but civil
conversation. I did want to give each of you a final thought. And Mr.
Bomberger, I started with you, so I'm going to give Mr. Veazey the
last word. What's your final thought, Mr. Bomberger? Do you ever see a
place in the future where the two of you might agree?

BOMBERGER: I think when you look at abortion and what it truly is and
it's the needless killing of innocent life, when you look at Planned
Parenthood and why it exists - a one billion dollar a year industry
with a one billion dollar budget, one billion dollars in assets, it's
all about money.

MARTIN: OK.

BOMBERGER: So I'm assuming that you (unintelligible).

MARTIN: Then I'm going to give Mr. Veazey the last word because he has
a right to answer that point. Mr. Veazey, I'm going to give you the
final thought.

VEAZEY: One of the things I want to point out to Mr. Bomberger is that
it's amazing how the religious right and all those who are against
abortion and that procedure, they are so interested in the fetus
development - fetus coming here - a child coming here. They accuse me
of being pro-abortion. I'm not pro-abortion, I'm pro-choice.

But what do they do? They wait until the child, not a fetus, the child
gets here and they abort them through lack of health care. They abort
them through lack of education. And you can see it in every major
city. I'm here in Chicago. I can walk through certain communities and
see kids, for all practical purposes have been aborted. Same thing in
Washington, in Central L.A., wherever you go.

But I do not here Mr. Bomberger, any others on that side ever trying
to push legislation to help poor kids and kids who have an
opportunity. And that ad about Obama being the next person could have
been an Obama, you've aborted through your lack of concern for the
social issues, you've aborted a lot of children that could have been
an Obama.

MARTIN: All right.

BOMBERGER: (unintelligible)

MARTIN: I think we're going to have to leave it there. We're going to
have to leave it there for now, gentlemen. And I thank you for this
conversation. To be continued.

The Reverend Carlton Veazey, who you just heard, is president and CEO
of the Religious Coalition of Reproductive Choice. He joined us from
member station WBEZ in Chicago. Ryan Bomberger is the co-founder and
chief creative officer of the Radiance Foundation. That's the group
that's behind a number of billboards that you may have seen in major
cities around the country. He joined us from Georgia Public
Broadcasting in Atlanta.

Gentlemen, I thank you both so much for joining us.

Doctors To Pregnant Women: Wait At Least 39 Weeks Date: Monday, July 18, 20=
11
Source: NPR
Author: Gretchen Cuda Kroen

In her living room, Caroline Nagy introduces the newest member of her
family ? the 6-week-old infant in a striped onesie cradled in her
arms. "This is Alex Joseph. He was born May 24th ? my birthday," she
says.

Their shared birthday wasn't entirely a coincidence. Two weeks before
her due date, Nagy was swollen, and uncomfortable. So she asked her
doctor for relief.

"I was just miserable. It was like uncomfortable to walk; I couldn't
sit on the floor and play; I felt like I was neglecting my first kid
because I just couldn't move and I couldn't do anything," says Nagy.
"So I asked, 'Is there any way I can speed this up and have a baby
earlier?' "

For Jackie McGinty, it wasn't discomfort but timing that caused her to
schedule her daughter's birth by C-section eight years ago. McGinty's
first child was delivered by C-section for medical reasons, and
although this time around she had hoped to deliver naturally, she had
just moved out of state and wanted her family nearby to help with the
baby.

"My mom was coming out and she was only going to come out for a few
weeks. I needed her to be there after the birth. ... So having the
option to schedule it was good for us," says McGinty.

Harm In Planning Too Far Ahead?

Stories like these are common. Statistics show that from 1990 to 2006
the percentage of women who induced labor more than doubled, and
nearly a third of women were having cesareans.

The increase wasn't because of emergencies, says Jay Iams, a
specialist in maternal fetal medicine at Ohio State University, but
rather because women and doctors began scheduling deliveries for
convenience ? "convenience for the mother, for the family, for the
physician," says Iams. Sometimes, Iams says, it's because patients say
to themselves, " 'I want only my doctor to be there. I don't want the
person who's on call.' "

Having a baby naturally requires lots of planning. But when it comes
to the arrival date of your bundle of joy, experts now say that
planning too far ahead can do more harm than good.

A full-term pregnancy lasts 40 weeks, but elective deliveries are
often planned for two or three weeks earlier. And even though 37 weeks
is also still considered full term, studies show that babies born even
a few weeks too early are at greater risk for health problems than
those who are born later. That has some doctors campaigning to curb
the trend of scheduled labor and delivery.

Millions Stare Death in the Face Amidst Ravaging Drought Date: Monday,
July 18, 2011
Source: Inter Press Service
Author: Miriam Gathigah

While Kenya struggles to cope with the influx of refuges fleeing the
drought in Somalia, it is estimated that about 1,300 people arrive
daily at the Dadaab refugee camp, the country is facing its own crisis
of malnutrition and starvation.

It takes on average nine days in 50-degree Celsius heat for Somali?s
fleeing the drought in their country to travel the 80 kilometres of
the sandy, expansive desert that separates Dadaab in Northern Kenya
from Somalia.

The journey to Dadaab is a treacherous one, made even more perilous as
it snakes through territories of lawlessness where armed bandits and
even police harass the refugees.

And when those who survive the journey finally reach Dadaab, they soon
realise that the camp is far from the haven they hoped it would be.

In Kenya an estimated five million people across the country are
facing starvation because of drought, according to Abbas Gullet, the
secretary general of the Kenyan Red Cross.

In the northern part of Kenya, the local Turkana community is facing
starvation, just like the refugees at Dadaab.

According to the United Nations Children?s Fund (UNICEF), from a
population of about 850,000 people in Turkana, more than 385,000
children and 90,000 pregnant and breastfeeding women are suffering
from acute malnutrition. This has increased the number of new
admissions of children suffering from malnutrition to a staggering 78
percent.

"This is a very serious situation, across the region (Horn of Africa)
more than 10 million people are affected. Of this, two million
children are severely affected with half a million of them suffering
from severe acute malnutrition and (many are) on the brink of death,"
UNICEF executive director, Anthony Lake, says. Related Links:

Author: Stephen Adams

According to the poll, nearly one in three (29 per cent) would refuse
to carry out such an abortion at all, if they were in such a position.

Abortions after 24 weeks are only legal if the developing baby is
determined to be at "substantial risk" of "serious handicap" in life.

There have been almost 18,000 such abortion since 2002, a handful for
matters as minor as cleft palate and club foot.

The survey of 733 students in Cardiff, London and Leeds, also found
that almost half of them (45 per cent) believed they should be able to
refuse to give medical treatment that ran against their ethical or
religious beliefs.

They were asked about their willingness to carry out 11 medical
practices, including providing abortions at various stages of
pregnancy, contraceptive services, and treating those who were drunk
or high on drugs.

Talk point: Have your say on population growth Date: Monday, July 18, 2011
Source: The Guardian (UK)
Author: Claire Provost

Population growth is blamed for everything from poverty and climate
change to crime and conflict. But does more people necessarily mean
more problems? With the world's population set to reach 7 billion this
year, will we see new conflicts as more people compete for the same
limited resources (land, water, food and energy)? And how will the
world's poorest countries be able to provide jobs and basic services
for their growing populations?

We'll be discussing these issues in this month's Global development
podcast. We'll discuss different ideas about the impact of population
growth on development and the environment in the world's poorest
countries. And we'll ask what aid donors and other development actors
should ? and shouldn't ? do about population issues.

Among the guests joining us in the studio will be Claire Melamed, head
of the growth and equity programme at the Overseas Development
Institute, and former head of policy at ActionAid UK. We'll also have
Roger Martin, chairman of the UK population charity Population
Matters, formerly known as the Optimum Population Trust. And down the
line from Nairobi, we will be joined by Eliya Zulu, executive director
of the African Institute for Development Policy and president of the
Union for African Population Studies.

In advance of the podcast, we want to get your thoughts. Is population
growth the biggest challenge facing poor countries? Or are fears about
a "population timebomb" unfounded? And how ? if at all ? should
governments, aid donors and other development actors engage with
population issues?

African HIV patients living `near-normal lifespan': study. Date:
Monday, July 18, 2011
Source: Canwest News Service (Canada)
Author: Carmen Chai

HIV patients in Africa who are receiving regular treatment can expect
to live a near normal lifespan, Canadian researchers suggest in the
world's first large-scale study to examine HIV patients' life
expectancy on the continent.

After studying 22,315 patients who were using combined antiretroviral
therapy (cART), scientists from the B.C. Centre for Excellence in
HIV/AIDS along with experts at the Universities of British Columbia
and Ottawa found that with early initiation and access to regular
treatment, those infected with HIV were living about two-thirds of a
normal lifespan.

"This is astounding news for people living with HIV in Africa who had
been living for several years now and were initially told to go home
to plan for their deaths. It changes everything," said lead researcher
Dr. Edward Mills, who is also Canada Research Chair in global health
at the University of Ottawa.

"There was nothing we could give to them but books to write stories to
their kids so their kids would have memories of them. Now we tell them
to prepare for a very long life," he said.

Mills' study, published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine as
the International AIDS Society conference continued this week in Rome,
was funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.

Life expectancy at birth for people who don't contract HIV in Uganda,
where Mills spent six years studying the disease, is 55 years old and
increases as people age healthily. Mills tracked the outcomes of the
patients, including 1,943 people who died, to analyze death rate and
overall health to determine an HIV patients' life expectancy. Results
showed, for the overall study cohort, life expectancy at age 20 was
another 26 years. Those who had treatment begin earlier, before their
immune systems deteriorated, lived longer.

In contrast, life expectancy at birth in Canada is 81, and HIV
patients receiving treatment at age 20 could live for another 49
years.

Mills' team believes the Ugandan study is a fair representation of the
situation in the rest of Africa.

Women fared better than men, with life expectancy for men at age 20
hitting another 19 years while women at the same age averaged an
additional 30 years.

"(Women) are much better about accessing treatment, they're much
better at testing for HIV and they're much better at getting care,"
Mills said, noting most women are tested while checking for pregnancy.

"We have a very big window for women through reproductive health. We
don't have anything like that for men," Mills said.

In Africa, men face a 47 per cent higher death rate compared to women, he s=
aid.

The cART therapy, developed by international researchers including
Canadians, is more readily available to most African nations, and has
expanded to remote areas but it is still not universally accessible.

There are more than 200,000 patients receiving cART in Uganda but
another 200,000 are waiting for treatment.

More than 33 million people - roughly Canada's entire population - are
infected with HIV worldwide, at least 7,700 people infected with HIV
each day and nearly 5,500 die daily from an AIDS-related illness.

Two-thirds of the world's HIV and AIDS patients live in sub-Saharan
Africa where only about 40 per cent of HIV-infected people are on
treatment.

The universal access target is 80 per cent, Mills said.

Still, with HIV patients living longer lives, experts should prepare
to fight the complications aging HIV patients will encounter from
heart problems to an increased risk of stroke, Mills said.

"Patients in their late 40s and early 50s develop a high rate of
cardiovascular disease and this is something no one's talking about,"
he said.

Mills applauded several African countries - including Uganda and
Lesotho - for their efforts in creating simplified, accessible
treatment while he named other nations, such as Congo as Botswana as
regions that were overwhelmed by large populations afflicted with the
virus.

In Botswana, one in three people have HIV.

COLUMN: Africa: HIV Rates Mounting Among Diaspora Date: Tuesday, July 19, 2=
011
Source: Gender Links
Author: Mariama Kandeh

While HIV prevalence rates are dropping in many parts of Africa they
are on the rise within African communities in other parts of the world
and experts think gender roles and harmful cultural practices are to
blame.

In the United Kingdom, Africans have the highest HIV prevalence. In
2009 an alarming 33% of all new cases were of African descent.
According to the UK Health Protection Agency, 70% of HIV-positive
women in Britain were born in Africa.

The Public Health Agency of Canada estimated in 2005 that the HIV
infection rate among Canada's black population was 12.6 times greater
than among other groups, noting that black women are four times more
likely to have HIV than white women.

Antoinette Andze* was diagnosed with HIV after she arrived in the UK
from Cameroon. Even though she is on antiretroviral treatments, she is
pale, weary and in bed in her London flat. At 40-years-old she lives
with four of her children and has another in Cameroon. Her youngest
child is also infected with HIV. Andze thinks she was infected by her
husband, who abandoned her after she was diagnosed.

"I am deeply worried about my kids, even now I spend most of my time
in the hospital, it is as if things are not getting any better and I
have no one to run to in this difficult situation," she said.

Andze's friends and family do not know she is HIV-positive and she
fears they would abandon her if they did. She attends a clinic far
from her community so no one will find out.

"Many people still believe that having HIV is a form of punishment or
witchcraft," says Fola Rogers-Saliu, a doctor and manager of the
African Emotional Support Service at the UK's Terrence Higgins Trust.
"People still live in fear, with stigma and discrimination rife.

Population rise poses multitude of challenges - Speaker Date: Tuesday,
July 19, 2011
Source: Daily News (Sri Lanka)

President Mahinda Rajapaksa opened the 27th Asian Parliamentarians'
Meeting on Population and Development at Mount Lavinia Hotel
yesterday.

Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa making the inaugural address at the two day
forum, noted that the rise in population combined with the paucity of
resources to sustain seven billion people, play a decisive role in the
outcome of endeavours to uplift the living standards of the people.

In this regard, he said that the forum could play an important role in
addressing related issues as it comprises parliamentarians who are the
actual representatives of the people.

While stressing that population rise poses to societies a multitude of
challenges, he said as the natural resources to sustain the population
of a country was limited, population stabilization was a must for
sustainable development, poverty reduction and prevention of
environmental degradation.

The Speaker also stressed that there was an urgent need for universal
access to reproductive health, family planning, information and
services, especially for young people.

"Women's education and empowerment play a key role in social and
economic development which in turn would have a positive influence on
population stabilization. Accessible information and services relating
to reproductive health also reduce maternal deaths and unplanned
pregnancies," he added.

While observing that the civil society could play a major role in
addressing population, reproductive health and sustainability issues,
the Speaker said that adequate technical and financial support should
be provided to strengthen health systems, to face the challenges of
the present day demands.

"Parliamentarians in this regard can act as a conduit between the
government and the society and also they could enact necessary
legislation, disseminate information, secure funding and coordinate
services for the benefit of the people they represent," he told the
gathering.

Speaker Rajapaksa also thanked the former Prime Minister of Japan and
the chairperson of APDA Yasuo Fukuda MP for his support to Sri Lanka
over the years and for the recognition bestowed on the country by
selecting Colombo as the venue for the forum.

He identified him as a close and sincere friend of Sri Lanka over a
long period. Health Minister Maithripala Sirisena delivering the
keynote address noted that what the forum decides as solutions to meet
the challenges posed by population escalation could make the world
population at seven billion a blessing in disguise.

He said that sustained public welfare programmes and investment in the
health and education sectors in Sri Lanka since 1948, led to the
achievement of a high quality of life among all people.

He said Sri Lanka's population had rose from 7 million in 1948 to 21.5
million today with a density of 310 people per square kilometre. The
average life expectancy too had risen from 43 in 1948 to 73 at
present.

He admitted that population increase brings about considerable
pressure on the limited resources of a country. He also noted that
this could have a bearing on the frequency of increased natural
disasters and emphasized the need for an eco friendly approach to
natural resource management. Over 100 Parliamentarians from 23
countries would deliberate ways and means of achieving population
stabilization for sustainable development and uplifting living
standards, in the region and the world in general under the theme 'The
World Population at 7 Billion'.

The two day forum is hosted by the Health Ministry. It is supported by
the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), International Planned
Parenthood Federation (IPPF) and Asian Forum of Parliamentarians on
Population and Development (AFPPD).

SWAZILAND: Confusion and panic over supply of ARVs Date: Monday, July 18, 2=
011
Source: IRIN - Plus News

Unease is mounting in Swaziland after reports that supplies of
antiretrovirals are dangerously low. Resources have never been
adequate to tackle the world?s highest HIV infection rate in the tiny
kingdom, but in recent months, the cash-poor government and dwindling
donor funding have led to increasing panic among people living with
HIV.

?Only Two Months Supply of ARVs Left,? headlined the front page of the
Swazi Observer recently, quoting an MP's remarks to parliament warning
that the country's economic troubles could put people's lives in
danger. One in four Swazis between the ages of 15 and 49 is living
with HIV - at 26.1 percent, the world's highest prevalence - in a
population of about one million.

?Drug droughts are [becoming] common in Swaziland. Hospitals go for
months without basic drugs and supplies. But ARVs are different. Like
TB drugs, the user cannot miss a day. I can tell you that people are
already very concerned,? said Sandile Hlope, a programme officer for a
Manzini-based HIV testing and counselling centre.

Swaziland is in the grips of an acute financial crisis. Social
services have been cut and public servants are facing looming
retrenchments - government is the country's biggest employer. In
addition, the Ministry of Agriculture last month reported a 29,000MT
shortfall in the annual maize requirement - the country?s staple food
- of about 114,000MT.

How long before drugs run out?

Health Minister Benedict Xaba went on government radio last week to
assure people that drug supplies would not run out at hospitals, and
reaffirmed government?s dedication to spending on national health
priorities, despite the cash crunch that has, among other things,
grounded government vehicles and halted some non-essential programmes.

More than 64,000 Swazis were receiving ARVs by the end of June, a
number expected to climb to about 69,000 by the end of July, according
to the Monitoring and Evaluation Unit at the Ministry of Health.
However, 200,000 Swazi adults are believed to be HIV-positive.

?The ARV rollout is going well in terms of fulfilling projections,?
said Charles Azih, information and data officer for the Swaziland
National AIDS Programme (SNAP). ?We have no reports of any clinics or
supply points running short of ARVs, and no one has come to our office
with such news,? he said.

Quantities of ARVs used in Swaziland are ordered on the basis of
current use, with projected use factored in, so the supply is always
expanding, Azih added. Related Links:

AFRICA: Political leadership key to male circumcision success Date:
Monday, July 18, 2011
Source: IRIN - Plus News

Countries that have been quick to incorporate medical male
circumcision into their HIV prevention programmes are already seeing
good results compared with those that have been slower to embrace the
procedure, say experts.

Following three African trials that proved the efficacy of male
circumcision in preventing vaginal HIV transmission to heterosexual
men, the UN World Health Organization in 2007 developed guidelines for
the scale-up of voluntary medical male circumcision. Some 14 African
countries have incorporated these into their national HIV programmes.

?In countries where there has been political leadership and community
buy-in, we are already seeing results from male circumcision scale-up,
while in countries like Uganda ? where one of the randomized
controlled trials took place ? we see that HIV incidence is on the
rise in comparison to neighbouring countries where male circumcision
programmes are in place and incidence is falling,? said Catherine
Hankins, UNAIDS chief scientific adviser, at the 6th International
AIDS Conference on HIV Pathogenesis, Treatment and Prevention in Rome.

Uganda?s President Yoweri Museveni has been accused of undermining
efforts to increase male circumcision by his scepticism about its
ability to prevent HIV. Most recently, Museveni visited western
Uganda, where media reports quoted him as saying organizations that
promoted the procedure were misguiding and could put the lives of many
people in danger ?since it had not been proven to be scientifically
true?.

Although the country launched a national male circumcision policy in
2010, progress in scaling it up has been slow.

Lesotho, Malawi, Rwanda and Uganda have so far failed to achieve any
momentum in achieving 80 percent coverage of male circumcision
recommended in order for the procedure to have the maximum benefit,
according to the US President?s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.
Ethiopia and Swaziland have achieved 12 and 14 percent respectively,
while Botswana and Zambia have achieved 4 percent and South Africa and
Tanzania have reached 3 percent. Mozambique, Namibia and Zimbabwe have
each achieved 1 percent coverage. Related Links:

HIV/AIDS: Treatment as prevention ? the tough road ahead Date: Monday,
July 18, 2011
Source: IRIN - Plus News

The sixth International AIDS Society Conference on HIV Pathogenesis,
Treatment and Prevention started optimistically as the hype
surrounding the use of antiretroviral treatment to prevent HIV
infection gained momentum. But the focus of much discussion in Rome
from 17-20 July will undoubtedly be on how to transform the recent
promising research findings into workable policy.

The most significant of these is the HPTN052 randomized control trial,
which found that earlier antiretroviral treatment can reduce the risk
of heterosexual HIV transmission by as much as 96 percent; other
studies have proven the efficacy of ARVs for prevention in
HIV-negative people.

"We need to ensure that the advances we are making in research ? such
as the now proven concept of antiretroviral treatment as a means of
HIV prevention ? are translated into action for people in developing
countries," said IAS local co-chair Stefano Vella, research director
at Italy?s Istituto Superiore di Sanit=E0, at the official opening of
the conference.

But translating the research into action will require money, and if
recent trends are any indication, that will be difficult, and there is
much scepticism about the ability to significantly increase the
numbers on treatment with such limited funds.

Donor pressure

"We need to keep up the pressure on donors... Donors are used to
seeing costs rising year after year, but now we can show them a light
at the end of the tunnel... We can show them that investing today will
lead to lower costs tomorrow," Brenda Waning, coordinator of market
dynamics with the health financing mechanism, UNITAID, said. "We also
need to learn how to do more with limited resources."

Treatment as prevention will mean putting significantly more people on
treatment earlier; at present, 15 million people are estimated to need
ARVs ? only 6.6 million have access to them.

"Treatment as prevention is possible, it is feasible, but we must not
fool ourselves into thinking it's going to be easy," said Paul de Lay,
deputy executive director of UNAIDS. "We put an additional 1.4 million
new people on treatment in 2010 ? if we maintain that momentum we will
not achieve the goal of 15 million on treatment by 2015.

"We need to get to US$22 to $24 billion a year from the $15 billion a
year we are currently spending; we need African governments to abide
by the Abuja Declaration commitment to spend 15 percent of national
budgets on health and we need donors to meet their commitments," he
added.

"If we can convince donors that we can stop the epidemic within a
finite amount of time, the money will be found," said Brian Williams,
an epidemiologist with the UN World Health Organization (WHO). Related

=A0EDITORIAL: Rwanda: Progress On Family Planning Encouraging Date:
Tuesday, July 19, 2011
Source: The New Times (Rwanda)

Officials at the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning have
announced a remarkable improvement in family planning among the
Rwandan people, which currently stands at about 42 percent and 43
percent, in the rural and urban areas, respectively.

Figures show a steady decline in the average number of children per
Rwandan woman, from the previous six down to four, with the likelihood
of the figure going further down, to three, in the coming years.

Considering that only 10 percent of the population used family
planning methods in 2005 and by 2010 up to 45% of married couples were
using contraception, it is evident that more couples have responded
positively to the government's appeal for birth control.

The country's long-term development agenda would come under enormous
pressure, if a potential population explosion is not averted. It would
be extremely difficult for any country to realise its dreams without
checking its population growth rate. Related Links:

BLOG: Growing sense of hope at international Aids conference Date:

Author: Sarah Boseley

There appears to be real excitement at the International Aids Society
conference in Rome (sadly I'm not there in person, but that is the
feedback). There is still no vaccine on the horizon - once the biggest
hope - but the news from recent studies that taking antiretroviral
drugs protects people without HIV from infection (see the story here)
and reduces the risk of people with HIV passing it to their partners
(here) has changed the landscape. Suddenly we are in a world where
Aids is more preventable than ever before - and both prevention and
treatment come pill-shaped.

So there is no shortage of important people calling for more funds and
more action to roll out drugs to the nine million people in developing
countries estimated to need them right now. Michel Sidib=E9, executive
director of UNAIDS, said it was an affront to humanity that there were
gaps in coverage.

"We have to remember that history will judge us not by our scientific
breakthroughs, but how we apply them," he said.

Doctors' anti-abortion views could impact on women's access to service
Date: Monday, July 18, 2011
Source: The Guardian (UK)
Author: Denis Campbell

Pregnant women could find it harder in future to obtain an abortion
because of the growing number of doctors who are opposed to carrying
out terminations.

A survey of medical students has found that almost half believe
doctors should be allowed to refuse to perform any procedure to which
they object on moral, cultural or religious grounds, such as
prescribing contraception or treating someone who is drunk or high on
drugs.

Abortion provoked the strongest feelings among the 733 medical
students surveyed, according to the study in the Journal of Medical
Ethics. "The survey revealed that almost a third of students would not
perform an abortion for a congenitally malformed foetus after 24
weeks, a quarter would not perform an abortion for failed
contraception before 24 weeks and a fifth would not perform an
abortion on a minor who was the victim of rape," said researcher Dr
Sophie Strickland.

"In light of increasing demand for abortions, these results may have
implications for women's access to abortion services in the future,"
she added.

Concern about termination services is rising, with fewer doctors
willing to perform the procedure, according to the Department of
Health. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has
voiced concern about the "slow but growing problem of trainees opting
out of training in the termination of pregnancy and is therefore
concerned about the abortion service of the future".

Ann Furedi, chief executive of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service,
said: "Abortion is taught increasingly infrequently in medical school,
and students may not be required to engage much with the reasons why a
woman may find herself with an unwanted pregnancy and the distress
this may cause. All of us involved in women's reproductive healthcare
need to ensure that young doctors understand why women need abortions,
and that this is a profession to be proud of."

Some 45.2% of those surveyed believed doctors should have the right to
refuse to treat someone when doing so clashed with their personal
beliefs, but 40.6% disagreed. "Once qualified as doctors, if all these
respondents acted on their conscience and refused to perform certain
procedures, it may become impossible for conscientious objectors to be
accommodated in medicine," said Strickland.

BLOG: Who Are Teens' Sexual Role Models? Turns Out, It's Their Parents
Date: Tuesday, July 19, 2011
Source: Time
Author: Bonnie Rochman

Parents may think their teens aren't listening to them about anything,
let alone sex, but new research shows that 45% of teens consider their
parents ? not their friends or celebrities ? their sexual role models.

The study from the University of Montreal upends conventional wisdom
that teens put no stock in what their parents think. More teens relied
on parental advice than on guidance from their friends, who influenced
just 32% of survey respondents. Even fewer ? 15% ? cared what
celebrities thought.

For lead author Jean-Yves Frappier, a professor of pediatrics at the
University of Montreal and president of the Canadian Paediatric
Society, the study's findings reinforced his belief that parents need
to stay involved in their kids' lives even if it seems like their
teens would prefer they get lost.

Even many of Frappier's medical colleagues have dismissed parental
influence during the teen years as a lost cause. ?People are surprised
parents are role models,? he says. ?But I'm not. Parents are the most
important role models for teens.?

OP-ED: On population and policies Date: Tuesday, July 19, 2011
Source: The Financial Express (Bangladesh)
Author: Abdul Bayes

The world population has been growing very fast, it took the world
population millions of years to reach the first billion, then 123
years to reach the second, and 33 years to reach the third, 14 years
to the fourth and 13 years to the fifth billion and possibly less than
10 years to reach the additional one billion (a la Amartya Sen).

In the demographic discourse, Malthus is crowned as having pointed to
the doomsday lurking on the heels of population growing at geometric
progression and food supply at arithmetic progression. But before him,
says Sen, Condorcet (the French Mathematician) raised the issue of
overpopulation with "the increase in the number of men surpassing
their means of subsistence" resulting in "either in a continual
diminution of happiness and population, a movement truly retrograde,
or, at least, a kind of oscillation between good and evil".

Coming to this part of the world, one of the planks of early pessimism
about Bangladesh's socio-economic progress was the question of
population size relative to the size of the land that the country has.
The very high man-land ratio of early years possibly precluded any
positive projection. But Bangladesh managed to thrive through thick
and thin and, over time, population growth decelerated and food
production accelerated to keep the country on an even keel. Thanks to
the family planning movement marshaled against high population growth
and technological breakthrough in food production - two of the
important advancements that Malthus possibly overlooked in delivering
the doomsday thesis. Anyway, Malthusian fears have waned if not
evaporated.

The population of Bangladesh is estimated to be 142.3 million -
roughly 20 million more than a decade ago and about double over 1974.
The preliminary observation of the latest census reveals that
Bangladesh's population grew at 1.34 per cent per year during the last
decade or so. The household size has shrunk to 4.4 against 4.8 in 2001
and 5.5 in 1991. This could be due to migration and population control
measures accompanied by growing awareness about small family size.
However, the statistics on population has come under criticism from
different corners. The Bangladesh Economic Survey 2011 posits the
country's population at 146.7 million and growth rate at 1.36 per cent
for 2009! It was 143.8 million in 2008 with a growth rate of 1.45 per
cent. Assuming a low growth rate of 1.34 per cent per annum, the total
population of the country would lie not below 150 million. A correct
estimation of population size is always desirable because production,
imports and other indicators depend on the size of the population of
the country.

However, taking the census result at its face value, and since the
area of Bangladesh has not increased over time, the population density
in the country has increased to 964 people per square kilometre from
834 in 2001. I recollect (late) Dr Mahabubul Huq's seminal observation
on Bangladesh's population density made decades back: if all the
people of the world were accommodated in the USA, the population
density there would not be as high as it is in Bangladesh. It is the
third most populated country in Southeast Asia after India and
Pakistan embracing 1.2 billion and 184.8 million respectively.

The remarkable progress is on the front of reduction of the population
growth rate. From as high as about 3.0 per cent immediately after
independence, the population growth rate per annum perked at an
average of 2.3 per cent in the 1980s, 1.5 per cent in the 1990s and
now 1.34 per cent. But remember that when the base is high, a small
rate of growth implies a big total and vice versa. It is thus no
wonder that every year about 2.0 million people are added to the
titanic total. Another improvement is that the male-female gap has
reduced. Now Bangladesh has 100.3 males against 100 females as
compared to 1006.4 males against 100 females in 2001. It may be
mentioned here that South Asia is the only region where males surpass
females whereas in other continents, females exceed males. It may be
due to preference for boys in this part of the world. The preference
for boys comes for security reasons in old age. It is believed that
boys will provide support to the parents in their old age.

The population growth rate must be reduced further in the wake of
dwindling cultivable land. An average Bangladeshi woman of child
bearing age produces 2.15 children now as against 5.1 in 1981. The
infant mortality rate has gone down from 111 per 1000 live births to
39 at the moment. But, as noted earlier, the higher base leads to huge
population even though the growth rate tends to fall over time. The
massive campaign against population expansion and for population
control must firmly stand up shedding all sorts of complacency about
declining growth rate. Fertility must be contained. And this should be
in Condorcet's line of thinking, as Amartya Sen argues, when people
"will know that, if they have a duty towards those who are not yet
born, that duty is not to give them existence but to give them
happiness". This type of reasoning buttressed by the expansion of
education, especially female education would lead people to lower
fertility rates and smaller families which people would choose
voluntarily. Bangladesh has appreciably traveled through this process
adopting the family planning movement and greater availability of
knowledge and facilities that helped reduce the fertility rate from
5.1 in 1981 to 2.2 in 2009 to debunk the belief that people will not
voluntarily adopt family planning in the less developed countries.

Particular mention may be made of empowerment of young women through
education and job creation. In collaboration with government, NGOs can
play a pivotal role in this context. At the end of the day, it is
employment generation that raises opportunity costs of children and
reduces family size. Another important area is health care facilities.
I strongly stand in support of community clinics in rural areas, not
just for employment of political cadres, for its socio-economic
impacts. In a country where wealth is health, the government should
provide facilities to the "un-wealthy" and "un-healthy" poor people in
rural areas. It is needed for income generation, to reduce infant
mortality, and thus affect fertility choices. And finally should I
mention about "missing markets" like credit, insurance, social
security schemes etc. that drives towards a preference for more
children?

By and large, high economic growth and development is necessary for
taming the turbulent population since development is called the best
contraceptive. And to reach that goal, we need to make the
institutions right and initiate concerted moves with earnest political
commitments.

Sexual health checks decline as finances tighten Date: Tuesday, July 19, 20=
11
Source: The Irish Times
Author: EITHNE DONNELLAN

Monetary difficulties are resulting in a fall-off in the numbers
attending Well Woman clinics for sexual health testing

THE RECESSION is having a significant impact on the numbers availing
of testing for sexually transmitted infections and fertility,
according to the medical director of Dublin s Well Woman Centres, Dr
Shirley McQuade.

At the launch of the centre s latest annual report yesterday, she also
said that more women were taking breaks from the contraceptive pill
for cost reasons.

She said women sometimes turn up and say they hadn t taken it for
three to four months because they couldn t afford it, and seek advice
on cheaper options.

In addition, a trend first reported a year ago when the centre said
increasing numbers of women attending its three pregnancy counselling
services in the capital were considering terminating pregnancies as a
consequence of the recession, had continued over the past 12 months,
she said.

The report states that increasingly a presenting element in the
counselling session revolves around financial concerns for clients who
may be without employment, or working on reduced hours and so on.

There would appear to be concerns for many that they are financially
unable to continue with a pregnancy due to the insecurity of future
employment or having mortgage related issues.

Dr McQuade said the numbers attending for cervical smear tests
remained constant at between 8,000 and 9,000 a year, but this is a
free service under the national cervical cancer screening programme.

However, she said the numbers attending for testing which must be paid
for, such as testing for chlamydia a sexually transmitted infection
which can have no symptoms but could lead to infertility if untreated
had fallen.

While more than 4,500 women were tested for the infection in 2008,
this dropped to less than 3,500 in 2010. This drop, the report says,
reflected the overall decrease in numbers attending the clinics and
also the reluctance of people to incur additional costs even though
the extra cost is only EUR 15 for the test .

An analysis of some 12,000 chlamydia test results taken between 2008
and 2010 by Well Woman found the highest prevalence of infection was
among those aged under 20, where up to 15 per cent of those screened
had the infection.

The numbers of men and women availing of full screens for a whole
range of sexually transmitted infections has also declined over the
last three years, down from almost 3,000 in 2007 to 1,600 last year.

The report says this is probably due to a combination of factors
including less money available for discretionary spending and less
people in the at-risk age group now living in the country . Full
screening for a couple costs EUR 200.

While screening for sexually transmitted infections is available free
at a number of public hospitals, the waiting times for appointments
could be up to eight weeks, said Dr McQuade.

Putting off check-ups or delaying treatment for an infection may
result in people compromising their sexual and reproductive health,
she added.

Dr McQuade also said that since computerised records began at the
centre in 2002, there had been an increase every year in the number of
couples attending for initial infertility investigations.

Last year, however, was the first year the numbers coming into Well
Woman clinics for such a consultation declined, and she believes this
is yet another example of how the recession may be impacting on women
s reproductive health.

Baby steps to relax one-child policy Date: Tuesday, July 19, 2011
Source: South China Morning Post

The mainland's one-child policy has long since achieved the aim of
curbing population growth for the sake of faster economic progress.
However, it has left a legacy of sex determination and abortion,
distortion of the birth ratio in favour of males, an ageing society
and the prospect of millions of men without women, destined to remain
single.

At the same time, hundreds of millions have emerged from poverty, and
incomes and living standards continue to rise - so the Communist
Party's economic policies have worked. But if there is one that should
be revisited now, before too few people of working age have to support
too many elderly citizens and gender imbalance creates social
instability, it is population policy.

It is good, therefore, that Guangdong has asked Beijing for permission
to pilot a province-wide relaxation of the one-child policy, under
which couples could have a second baby if either one of the spouses is
a single child. That goes further than initiatives by some provinces
to allow urban couples to have a second child if both of the spouses
do not have siblings, and would further liberalise the rule that rural
couples can have a second child if their first is a girl. Even though
Guangdong is the most populous province, with more than 100 million
people, the plan is unlikely to make much difference. Beijing remains
unlikely to make a major shift away from a fundamental policy any time
soon, but on humane and moral grounds any incremental dispensation
that might bring that day a little closer has to be welcomed.

Strict enforcement of the rules has certainly slowed population growth
and contributed to the economic miracle, but at the cost of a growing
demographic deficit that could exact a high price unless the party
changes course.

The latest 10-yearly census figures show that those aged 60 or older
rose in number by almost 3 per cent to 13.3 per cent of the
population, while those 14 and under fell 6.3 per cent to 16.6 per
cent. Project these trends into coming decades and they pose a risk to
economic gains. Indeed, many economists warn that China's phenomenal
growth could be slowed by a greying society, a dwindling labour pool
and pressure on social security.

Social science academics say that if more Guangdong couples are
allowed to have a second child that would hardly budge the national
birth rate, particularly given other disincentives like rising housing
and living costs and the need to save for old age and health care.

Even a perceived benefit for Hong Kong - fewer mainland mothers
competing for maternity beds in the city in order to have a second
child - is dubious. Right of abode in the city and other advantages
for children born here remains a powerful attraction.

Somalia on verge of famine Date: Monday, July 18, 2011
Source: CBC News (Canada)

The United Nations is poised to declare a famine in parts of Somalia
as a humanitarian emergency persists in drought-affected communities
across the Horn of Africa.

More than 10.7 million people are in need of assistance as the Horn of
Africa experiences its driest period in 60 years, says the United
Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs.

Several humanitarian groups have estimated the number at risk is
already over 11 million, as people struggle to cope with persistent
drought, high food prices and conflict.

The UN has not yet declared the current food crisis a famine, but
Brian Stewart, a distinguished senior fellow at the Munk School for
Global Affairs at the University of Toronto, told CBC News that the UN
is expected to declare a famine in some areas of Somalia within 48
hours.

In parts of the Horn of Africa, food insecurity has already reached
emergency levels =E2[#x20ac]" one level below famine.
"Famine/catastrophe" is the worst-case scenario on a five-level scale
used to gauge food security.

The scale uses several indicators to declare a famine, including acute
malnutrition in more than 30 per cent of children, at least two deaths
per 10,000 people every day and access to less than four litres of
water a day. Large-scale displacement of people, civil strife and
pandemic illness are also taken into consideration.

The last time a major famine was declared in the Horn of Africa was
1984-85, when a catastrophic drought in Ethiopia left more than one
million people dead. South Somalia has been particularly hard hit by
the current crisis, with thousands of people fleeing the country every
day. "Added to the drought, this is a region which suffers insecurity
and conflict, population growth, poverty and over-utilization of
land," said Valeria Amos, the UN emergency relief co-ordinator for
humanitarian affairs.

Roughly 120,000 people are sheltering in Dollo Ado, Ethiopia. In
Kenya, more than 380,000 people are camped at Dadaab, a sprawling
network of camps that is well over capacity and ill-equipped to serve
the influx of people who are still pouring into the area from
neighbouring Somalia.

Aid groups and UN agencies are calling for more assistance to meet the
mounting need. Roughly $835 million US has been received to assist
people in the Horn of Africa, but $1 billion more is needed, the UN
said.

Canada has contributed roughly $22 million, but is expected to
announce new funding within a week, Stewart said.

"Normally Canada is expected to pay up to four per cent of major
humanitarian emergencies," he added.

Stewart, who was one of the first journalists to alert the world to
the Ethiopian famine in the 1980s, said the key need is to buy
sufficient food and water from inside Africa.

"Shipments from abroad take far too long and take away from Africa's
own potential to deliver good and fast supplies," he noted.

Canadian International Co-operation Minister Bev Oda will travel to
the Dadaab refugee camps as part of a visit to drought-stricken areas.
She's expected to meet with government representatives and aid groups
who have been working with people affected by the growing food crisis.

Maternal deaths under-reported: health dept review Date: Tuesday, July 19, =
2011
Source: Indian Express
Author: Anuradha Mascarenhas

* While undergoing a Caesarean section at a city hospital, 30-year-old
Rati Kapoor (name changed) suddenly became breathless with
palpitations and died on the operation table. The clueless doctors
have still to come to terms with the fact that she died due to heart
ailment (mitral stenosis) that should have been diagnosed clinically
as part of natural course of delivery.

* In another case, it was lack of crucial post operative care post
delivery that led to 32-year-old Smita Shah's (name changed) death.
She died due to pulmonary embolism and was not stabilised before
transferring to another hospital. She died during the transfer.

For the first time, a case-by-case review of each of the 28 maternal
deaths that took place from April to June this year in the Pune
division has revealed that deaths are being under-reported. Deputy
Director of Health, Pune division Dr Uddhav Gawhande has set up its
own regional committee to review maternal deaths.

He said Accredited Social Health Workers (ASHA's) were not reporting
the deaths in Pune and Solapur and this should be a wake up call to
save the mothers.

"We do not want to term this exercise as a fault-finding one. We are
collecting facts and re-reviewing cases under the PMC, PCMC, Pune
rural and Solapur region areas to sensitise officials on the
importance of compulsory registration of maternal deaths," Gawhande
said.

The review committee met on July 13 and observed that there were only
28 deaths from April to June this year out of which 21 were
post-partum deaths, four ante natal, one during delivery and two cases
out of state ones. Seven deaths were from Pune rural, six from PMC
area, two from PCMC area, 11 from Solapur Municipal Corporation area
and two from rural parts of Solapur. Twenty-four women died at
institutions/hospitals, three on the road and one at home.

Cases were under-reported as usually 30 deaths are expected in a
population of 1 lakh. Hence a re-review of cases found that ASHA
workers under the National Rural Health Mission had yet to be
sensitised to report the deaths to the higher authorities. "Now, we
have made it compulsory to register maternal deaths at the gram
panchayat level. Instructions have also been issued to the civil
surgeon at Pune District Quality Assurance Committee to improve
reporting of cases.

Convener of Save the Mother initiative of Federation of Obstetrics and
Gynaecological Society of India Dr Sanjay Gupte welcomed the review
but cautioned that such an exercise should not turn into a fault
finding mission which would then affect reporting of deaths. He also
made a strong case for doctors to be aware that new guidelines need to
be followed to treat ante-natal care patients.

Planned Parenthood clinics provide more prenatal visits than meets eye
Date: Monday, July 18, 2011
Source: The Star-Ledger (Newark, New Jersey)
Author: Bill Wichert

STATEMENT Says Planned Parenthood provides about 140 visits for
prenatal care in each state. Date: 07/11/2011 Context: A speech on the
Senate floor by Sen. Michael Doherty (R-Warren) RULING False. The
statement is not accurate When Democrats and Republicans met on the
floor of the New Jersey Senate on July 11 to discuss overriding vetoes
handed down by Gov. Chris Christie, the debate ultimately turned to
whether $7.5 million for family-planning services should be reinstated
-- some of which would go to Planned Parenthood.

Democrats touted the importance of that funding for New Jersey
families. Sen. Loretta Weinberg (D-Bergen) said of the clients served:
"They are women who come for prenatal and postnatal health services so
that they do have healthy families."

But Republican Sen. Michael Doherty argued the organization doesn't
provide much prenatal care "There's a lot of talk about prenatal care
and the fact is that Planned Parenthood just does not provide many
prenatal visits. It's about 140 visits for each state in the entire
country," said Doherty, who represents Warren County and parts of
Hunterdon County. "So we're talking (about) an organization we're
supposed to be sending people we care about to get top-notch care for
prenatal visits and it turns out that they don't really see a lot of
patients."

A resolution to override that veto failed in a 25-14 vote.

PolitiFact New Jersey found Doherty, a conservative, was right about
prenatal care representing a small part of the services offered by
Planned Parenthood, but he is wrong about there being about 140 visits
in each state.

Using the senator's own reasoning, the number would be about 800
visits per state.

First, let's explain where Doherty received his information.

Doherty referred us to a fact sheet prepared by the Planned Parenthood
Federation of America, showing that 7,021 prenatal clients were served
nationwide in 2009. Based on that figure, Doherty determined there
were, on average, about 140 prenatal patients per state.

Here's the problem: the fact sheet said "clients," but Doherty
referred to "visits" on the Senate floor.

Clients refers to people. Visits refers to the numbers of times a
client goes to Planned Parenthood.

When we checked with Michele Jaker, executive director of Planned
Parenthood Affiliates of New Jersey, she said Planned Parenthood
centers provided a total of 40,489 prenatal visits across the country
in 2009, which is the latest data available.

Using the same formula that Doherty did, that number equates to about
809 visits per state.

Jaker could not provide the number of visits in New Jersey, but said
581 prenatal clients were served in the Garden State in 2009.

"His number right off the bat is wrong," said Jaker, referring to Doherty.

Jaker added in an e-mail that Doherty's approach -- dividing the
number of prenatal patients by 50 states -- was not an accurate
assessment, because several states "only have one health center and
don't have the facilities to provide prenatal care."

Told about our findings, Doherty said: "I think you're splitting hairs."

But for his overall argument that Planned Parenthood sees few prenatal
patients, Doherty is right.

According to the same fact sheet, "other women's health services,"
which includes prenatal care, only accounted for 10 percent of all
services provided by Planned Parenthood nationwide in 2009.

Figures provided by Jaker show prenatal clients represented about 0.6
percent of the 91,617 patients served by New Jersey centers in 2009.

Jaker said the number of prenatal clients served by Planned Parenthood
is due to limited funding and the needs of the community. If a center
cannot provide prenatal care to a woman, it will refer her to another
resource in the community, she said.

Pointing out how many pregnancies may go unnoticed, Donald Chervenak,
president-elect of New Jersey Obstetrical and Gynecological Society,
said Planned Parenthood is helpful in providing pregnancy testing.
Through earlier prenatal treatment, medical problems can be addressed
sooner, Chervenak said.

Doherty said Planned Parenthood doesn't provide many prenatal visits,
saying the figure was "about 140 visits for each state in the entire
country." That figure is way off, because Doherty was using the number
of clients. The actual number would be more like 800 visits per state.

Figures provided by Planned Parenthood confirm that prenatal care
represents a small part of the services offered, but since the
senator's figures were inaccurate to such a large degree, we rate the
statement False. STATEMENT Says Planned Parenthood provides about 140
visits for prenatal care in each state. Date: 07/11/2011 Context: A
speech on the Senate floor by Sen. Michael Doherty (R-Warren) RULING

Nigeria; One Year After - Girls Still Trapped in Malian Sex Camps
Date: Tuesday, July 19, 2011
Source: Leadership (Nigeria)

Thousands of trafficked Nigerian girls are trapped under dehumanising
conditions as sex slaves in Mali. And for over one year that their
condition was brought to the notice of the Federal Government, the
agencies in charge - the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, NAPTIP and NEMA
- seem to be foot-dragging in the quest to rescue and bring them home.

It has been almost a year since National Agency for the Prohibition of
Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP) lamented its inability to rescue tens
of thousands of Nigerian girls in Mali and neighbouring African
countries. According to the NAPTIP, there are over 20,000 Nigerian
girls trafficked to Mali and held against their will in slavish
conditions and forced to work as prostitutes.

Following increasing reports from preachers and aid workers over the
plight of these girls, NAPTIP sent a fact-finding mission late last
year and discovered that the situation was far worse than the reports.

NAPTIP executive-secretary, Simon Egede, while seeking the assistance
of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) in February this
year, said that a fact-finding mission he led to Mali discovered
brothels in Bamako (capital of Mali), Mopti and Kayes filled with
Nigerian girls trafficked for prostitution. He said that the girls
charged about 500CFA or N150 for a round of sex.

The girls are held under inhuman conditions in tiny shacks and were
forced to entertain about 20 men every night. They were told that they
must offset the cost of transporting them to Mali before they regain
their freedom. Gory tales of sex abuse and violence trail the lives of
these girls, many still in their mid-teens. They are beaten, starved,
raped and traded like slaves.

In an interview with a media house in December 2010, NAPTIP spokesman,
Arinze Orakwue, said, "It is clear it is not consensual. They have no
freedom of movement. They are not allowed to go outside or even make a
phone call."

Operation Timbuktu

Subsequently, NAPTIP, charged with fighting human trafficking and the
only one of such agency in West Africa, launched 'Operation Timbuktu'
in 2010 to secure the release of these girls.

"'Operation Timbuktu' will be executed with the Malian authorities to
free the girls and ensure their safe return to Nigeria," Egede was
reported to have said at the time.

Having identified the sites and brothels where the girls are located,
many thought it would be a matter of days and they were released. More
than a year later, Egede was still telling Nigerians: "The operation
is intended to withdraw about 200 Nigerian young girls between the
ages of 15-19 who are sex-slaves."

But the rescue mission failed. "The first thing that is preventing
their return is support from the Malian authorities. What we want Mali
to do is to say: 'Nigeria, come! We will support you to strike, to
engage in law enforcement action to get the girls back.'"

"Definitely, I want to see diplomatic pressure on Mali," insists Mr.
Orakwue. "It is an emergency."

It is obvious that NAPTIP lacks the intelligence, determination and
logistics required to undertake the rescue operation since it involves
a foreign country. It seems to hope more on the goodwill of Malian
authorities than its own proactive efforts.

The excuses of language barrier and unwillingness on the part of
Malian officials cannot explain why 'Operation Timbuktu' failed.

Lack Of Coordination

Speaking with LEADERSHIP over the fate of 'Operation Timbuktu',
Orakwue denied that it had failed. Though he did recognise that it was
an emergency and that the agency would need huge support, it appeared
that NAPTIP was not talking to the right persons and organisations
that could help with the problem.

He said, "The agency is making a multi-pronged approach to bring back
the girls. We shared the report with other sister law enforcement
agencies, organisations in the UN (United Nations) system.

"We also sent our findings to the office of the attorney-general and
the National Security Adviser (NSA). The essence was to draw the
attention of partners and government to this unwholesomeness. We have
articulated a rescue, withdrawal, evacuation and rehabilitation
program for these unfortunate Nigerians.

"Secondly, we want to build synergy in the project to enable us tackle
this menace in Mali. Some of our partners, like the United Nations
Office for Drugs and Crime (UNODC), International Office of Migration
(IOM) and the Switzerland government have shown intent to support.
Presently poor funding position of the agency may jeopardise our
prompt intervention.

"On another score, it warrants and justifies our intent to seek
assistance from partners. It is a huge budget to bring the girls back
and give them meaningful life than the dreadful privations in Mali.
The executive secretary promised that the agency would go to any
length to bring the girls back home.

He said: "We will not let off on that. The program is still on course.
Part of our frustration is the language problem between both
countries. Up until now, we are still expecting a response from the
Malian police chief on the way forward, because we had discussions
with him. We are stepping up our efforts to fast-track their support.
A team of NAPTIP operatives visited Mali again to explore further
avenues to engage the Malian government. We are hopeful it will yield
fruit.

"We shared our report with the ministry of foreign affairs because we
have also adopted a hands-on approach.

"The problem in the Northern part of Africa has engaged not just
government but also NEMA. They have been saddled with evacuating
Nigerians in that troubled spots, including Cote d'Ivoire. You will
agree that all these problems have followed in quick succession,
requiring swift attention from government which NEMA executed
expeditiously. We have gone back to the drawing board with NEMA to put
the steam back on the project."

When LEADERSHIP contacted NEMA, the agency's spokesman, Yusha'u
Shuaib, said, "We are working with NAPTIP towards that. NAPTIP has
contacted our agency over the issue. The truth is that we have done
little because of unnecessary bureaucratic issues that dog the rescue
plan.

"It is true that NEMA and NAPTIP are collaborating towards the safe
evacuation of Nigerian girls in Mali back to the country. The
collaboration is still ongoing and we hope soon that all necessary
things will be on ground to overcome the challenges.

"We must get all necessary implications and approval, especially when
it comes to an operation that has to do with another country. We have
to consider diplomatic relations, logistics and other requirements of
evacuating the girls. You have to consider the state of the girls and
their health, and how to integrate them with their families. The
problem is not just a simple one of 'just go ahead and evacuate.'"

When asked about the diplomatic issues, he said, "We cannot comment on
that because it is not part of our schedule. It is left to the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs to sort out the diplomatic angle."

A source within NEMA who pleaded anonymity, told LEADERSHIP that it
was heart breaking that these girls were still trapped in Mali while
the nation is dilly-dallying on when and how to bring them back.

"Of course everybody in NEMA is aware of this case and we still don't
know what is holding our people from rescuing these girls. Everyday
these girls spend in captivity is an indictment of our nationhood and
the ability of the government to protect Nigerians anywhere."

Diplomatic Reason

Given that diplomatic issues topped the reasons why 'Operation
Timbuktu' has not got off the ground, LEADERSHIP sought audience with
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA). Its spokesman, Damian Agwu,
told our correspondent that the ministry was aware of the issue but
that extra bilateral diplomacy was required.

Agwu said, "We are aware. If we are not aware I won't be responding to
you. All our missions it is part of their station charter. Every
Nigerian mission has a station charter and they are supposed to use
that station charter to work with organisations like NAPTIP.

"Each mission has been mandated to facilitate access for officials of
NAPTIP in their countries of representation for the achievement of
their objectives. That is the only way we work - we can't be
everywhere. We use our missions, particularly those in Africa and
Europe where this problem is pronounced."

When asked if the ministry was still monitoring the issue, he
answered, "We get reports that are file by the missions. We have a
department that handles this kind of problem."

And on the state of the issue now, he again answered, "Don't we have a
domestic legislation already? There is a domestic legislation on child
trafficking."

When reminded that NAPTIP claimed that the Malian authorities were not
cooperating in bringing the girls back, he said, "In the case of Mali,
extra bilateral diplomacy will be required."

And has the ministry done this, Agwu answered, "That is by suggesting
extra-bilateral mission with officials of the Malian Embassy. Well, I
cannot answer that type of question because I don't work in the West
African Department where such matter is usually handled."

At the MFA, West African Department, a director in the ministry said
that the ministry was not aware of the issue.

"Otherwise, our ambassador in Mali has been very, very active. The
number of girls you are talking about, I can't really confirm that we
have up to that number. But if that is true, I am sure we would
immediately get in touch with our ambassador there, then - both NAPTIP
and MFA are serving the same country anyway - I can assure you that,
using our diplomatic channels, we should be able to get positive
response."

Another director in the ministry also denied knowledge of the trapped
Nigerian girls in Mali. LEADERSHIP was shown reports from Mali on two
girls rescued by Malian authorities. When reminded that there are
still tens of thousands of girls out there, the room went silent.

Since Mali is a member of the Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS), like Nigeria, LEADERSHIP sought to know if the
organisation was aware of this problem. The ECOWAS Commissioner, Human
Development and Gender, Dr. Adrienne Diop, told our correspondent that
it was not aware of the matter with Nigerian girls.

She said: "I don't know this particular issue. But if they (NAPTIP)
have noticed that there are some Nigerian girls in Mali who want to
come back, I don't see Mali stopping them.

"The Malian government does not get anything out of it. I don't see
any government refusing to facilitate the repatriation of victims. I
don't see it. I would like to be more educated on this issue and I
would gladly take it up. But I have not heard of it.

"But if those Nigerian girls are still in the hands of some
traffickers, some Nigerian traffickers who took them there, who the
Malian government or Malian counterpart of NAPTIP cannot get its hands
on, that is another issue. I don't think any government would be
reluctant, or not happy to repatriate citizens who are in distress
because it is problem for that government keeping them there. I am not
saying it is not happening but we need to have more evidence and facts
and, really, the nitty-gritty of this issue."

Whither 'Citizen-Centred Diplomacy'?

The Yar'Adua administration initiated what the then Minister of
Foreign Affairs, Ojo Maduekwe, called 'Citizen-Centred Diplomacy'.
This concept simply described it as 'diplomacy of consequences'.
According to Maduekwe, the acts of Nigeria towards other countries
would be defined by reciprocal gestures: "if you are nice to us, we
will be nice to you, too. But if you are hostile to us, we will be
also be hostile to you, too." Effectively, it calls for the
international community to take responsibility for its actions towards
Nigerians.

What irks many Nigerians about Nigeria's foreign policy is her
inability to defend and protect their interests in foreign countries,
which is the essence of any foreign policy.

Thousands of Nigerians are in prisons in foreign countries, some for
offences that the do not even comprehend.

Recent official records show that 23,584 Nigerians are in prisons in
foreign lands. That was the figure by June 2008. About 10,000
Nigerians are in prison in the United Kingdom alone and the UK
government is contemplating having them serve out their jail terms
here in Nigeria. Nigeria has not been able to exert her full weight in
the international scene. Her citizens are on death row in many parts
of the far east for crimes for which they were not given fair trials.
At one time, the Chinese government requested permission to return the
corpses of about 30 Nigerians in that country.

With many Nigerians currently condemned to death in several countries,
the then Permanent Secretary, MFA (2009), Ambassador Joe Keshi, said:
"If you ask me whether I am optimistic that these Nigerians will find
their way back home, the answer is no, I am not. I am talking about
the Nigerians on death row in countries all over the world."

It is antecedents like this that have left many Nigerians wondering if
the Nigerian government could bring back these girls. Given the
success of NEMA in bringing back Nigerians caught in the North Africa
and Middle East crisis, hopes were raised that its involvement would
see the girls brought back home. However, it is becoming increasingly
clear that the organisation saddled with tackling problems of human
trafficking, NAPTIP, has not deployed all its resources in rescuing
these trafficked girls in Mali and other West African countries.

With the foreign ministry showing lukewarmness and ECOWAS not aware of
the problem, it is obvious that the hapless girls still have to wait
for a long time to come home. As the new minister of foreign affairs,
Ambassador Olugbenga Ashiru, resumes duty, many analysts believe that
solving this problem should be top on his agenda given that
citizen-centred diplomacy is a prominent feature of Nigeria's foreign
policy.

COLUMN: Nigeria; Maternal Health And Midwifery Scheme (part 2) Date:
Friday, July 15, 2011
Source: Daily Trust (Nigeria)

Last week I commenced an article on 'The State of the World Midwifery
2011 ; Delivering Health, Saving Lives' which was released and shared
by the United Nation Population Fund (UNFPA) at the Durban, South
Africa International Confederation of Midwives (ICM) 29th Congress; 20
June 2011.

The report shows that the period of highest maternal, foetal and
newborn mortality is during labour and delivery and the 24 hours
thereafter. It also focuses on the professional workforce present with
women before, during and immediately after giving birth and on the
services they provide. In countries all over the world, retrospective
studies have attest that quality midwifery services are a
well-documented component of success in saving the lives of women and
newborns as well as promoting their health. A strong midwifery
workforce brings indirect benefits too, contributing to the
advancement of gender equality and women's rights and empowering women
to take care of themselves, their families, their communities and
their nations

The report provides interesting frameworks for action with respect to
policy directions. Plans for the development of the midwifery
workforce are needed to overcome the challenges articulated by country
respondents. In many settings a lack of prestige is associated with
the job and midwifery is not acknowledged as a profession in its own
right. The logical consequence of this is low salaries, which are
widespread and often less than the salary of a general nurse. Low
salaries, in turn, result in a lack of new recruits. In Liberia, for
example, midwives are among the lowest paid health workers in the
country and, not surprisingly, the number of midwives there has
reduced significantly in recent years.In Uganda, the Private Midwives
Association is providing support to the development of strategic plans
to ensure that midwifery is appropriately represented in future plans
for health service delivery.The Somali and Nursing and Midwifery
Association is promoting the training of more midwives, and
encouraging the government to develop incentives to encourage
deployment in rural areas.The Ethiopian Midwives Association is
working with the ICM/UNFPA Country Midwifery Advisor programme to
build capacity. They are working to improve the quality of midwifery
education, develop an effective regulatory body and ensure midwives
are represented at ministry level.

In many countries, there is lack of opportunity for professional
career development - a

demotivating factor for existing midwives. Many countries identified
this as an issue. Regional approaches to career development do provide
some options. For example, a post-graduate midwifery programme hosted
in Burkina Faso for candidates from seven French-speaking countries.
However, even in this example demand far exceeds the ten available
places per year. In the absence of opportunities for career
development, there is an increased likelihood that midwives will
consider leaving the profession. This contributes to the low status of
midwifery and leads to a lack of voice in policy development.
Countries reported that almost all the influential policymaking posts
in maternal and newborn health are occupied by doctors, most of whom
do not have a background in midwifery or in providing routine services
to pregnant women. Increasing the number of midwives prepared to
assume senior policy-making positions will require investment in
advocacy and leadership management training for senior midwives.

Some useful incentivizing to the midwifery workforce is documented, as foll=
ows;

Nearly one third of the countries surveyed reported some kind of
incentive scheme for midwives or health workers with midwifery
competencies.

Incentives mentioned include:

? housing and/or transportation allowance for hard-to-reach areas
(Liberia, Malawi, Mozambique, Uganda);

? health insurance and free capacity building (Nigeria);

? monetary incentives (Mozambique, Uganda) for retention in rural
areas; provision of midwifery kits (Sudan);

? performance-based incentives (Rwanda, Tanzania);

? Retention schemes for nurse/midwifery tutors (Zambia).

To track the success of incentive schemes, it is important to monitor
and evaluate the effectiveness of incentives where they are offered.
For example, which incentives work best and for whom, and in what
conditions. Various countries have initiated retention schemes,
especially for work in remote areas. Monitoring and evaluation of
these initiatives is urgently needed.

In Nigeria, based on the report the trend in maternal mortality from
1990 to 2010 is declining. In 1990 the maternal mortality ratio was
1100/100,000 live birth and by 2010 it has declined to 840/100,000
live births. For Nigeria to achieve Millennium Development Goal (MDG
5) by 2015, the ratio has to decline to 275 maternal death per 100,
000 lives. In all discussion within and without Nigeria, that
attainment will not be achieve , but of course that does not mean the
country is not making progress, but we need to accelerate effort to
push for more reduction in maternal death.

The core policy with respect midwives in Nigeria is the National
Midwifery Scheme which aims to reinforce the 2,488 midwives to be
deployed to local health facilities nationwide by introducing a policy
to increase the number of core service providers including Community
Health Extension Workers and midwives, with a focus on deploying more
skilled health staff in rural areas.

National policies in practice that will improve midwifery scheme are;

A national maternal and newborn health plan exists that includes the
midwifery workforce.

The national health workforce plan specifically addresses midwifery.

All maternal and newborn health services are free (public sector)

However while these policies are ground, we need to move beyond policy
development and go further to ensure proper implementation as well as
monitor and evaluate the performance of such policies. In conclusion,
when one goes to a primary health care, what is seen is an over
burdened, challenged and overwhelmed poorly motivated midwife
tirelessly working to reverse the trend of maternal and newborn death.
We need to reverse this trend and improve Nigeria's midwifery scheme.

HIV/AIDS rates rising among older adults, as longtime survivors or
newly infected Date: Monday, July 18, 2011
Source: Sacramento Bee (California)
Author: ANITA CREAMER

Thirty years ago, at the dawn of the age of AIDS, the miracle of
growing old was all but unimaginable for people with that diagnosis.

Today, the number of people 50 and older diagnosed with HIV or living
with AIDS is booming.

People 50 and older account for more than 15 percent of the nation's
new HIV diagnoses, according to the federal Centers for Disease
Control. That percentage is expected to double within the next four
years, making older adults America's fastest-growing HIV demographic.

Roughly 533,100 people ages 45 to 64 were living with HIV or AIDS as
of 2008, the CDC reported in June. Another 38,400 were 65 and older.

"The 45- to 64-year-old age group is growing so fast because they've
survived," said Janet Parker, client services director for
Sacramento's Center for AIDS Research Education and Services (CARES).
"For the most part, they're not new infections. The population is
aging."

These days, longtime survivors as well as the newly infected share not
only a diagnosis but also a hopeful prognosis: With good medical care,
they can live to a ripe old age.

"Some of our patients have been through it all," said Dr. Jody Gordon,
a Sutter Medical Group HIV specialist whose practice includes a
handful of patients in their 70s and 80s. "... If you are 50 and
contract HIV, the overwhelming probability is that we can get you on a
regimen and allow you to continue with your normal work. And you'll
live close to a normal life span."

The lion's share of older people with HIV are gay men who have lived
with the virus since the epidemic's early days. Besides aging issues,
they face the long-term medical toll of taking antiretroviral
medications to keep the virus under control.

But they're alive.

"I watched the rise of Harvey Milk in the Castro" district of San
Francisco, said Joseph Rosenblatt, 58, a former IT manager who moved
to Sacramento in 2004. "... It was a time of glory and celebration,
and then we were attacked by this unknown disease. People were dying
all over the place."

Rosenblatt was diagnosed with HIV in 1984, although he says a
retroactive test of blood he had submitted for another medical study
showed he was positive as early as 1980, a year before the CDC
identified the AIDS virus.

The disease ravaged San Francisco in the 1980s and early 1990s, but
Rosenblatt didn't get ill until 1997, two years after the first
cocktail of anti-retroviral medications was introduced. Although newer
drugs have fewer side effects, some people suffered significant
problems from the early AIDS drugs. Rosenblatt -- who eventually
developed bladder cancer and had his bladder and prostate removed --
was one of them.

Medications saved his life, but their complications also led him to go
on disability.

"Young people think if you get HIV, no problem, just take the meds.
For me, the meds were the problem, not HIV," Rosenblatt said.

Evidence suggests that some HIV drugs may accelerate the aging
process, said Gordon, with patients more prone to the early onset of
conditions such as high cholesterol, neuropathy, heart disease and
osteoporosis.

Michael Jentes, 56, is a CARES manager and longtime survivor who lived
in San Francisco at the epidemic's height. By 2001, he was back home
in Sacramento, slowly recovering from Stage IV colon cancer and coping
with full-blown AIDS.

Many of his older clients have healthy attitudes and lives, he says.
They take their meds and regularly get blood tests.

But for other people, he said, "When they're diagnosed, their whole
life comes to an end. This is a serious, chronic illness, but it's
also a life-changing event."

Just ask Deborah Jane Rafter, now 61. In late 2009, she learned she
was infected with HIV. Her boyfriend of almost 13 years died of AIDS
within six months.

"He'd been tested, but he didn't adhere to a medical protocol," said
Rafter, a Sacramento housing consultant. "He was in HIV denial. He
didn't tell me until February 2010, when he was in the heat of
dementia from this virus. He cried and told me he was sorry."

She grieves for him still, and wants others to learn from her story.

"This drove me into a state of panic and sorrow unlike anything I've
ever experienced," she said. "That doesn't need to happen to other
people. We need to be smart and educated. ...

"We can't give ourselves to trust any more. That's shattered. We need
to give ourselves to the medical community and get tested."
