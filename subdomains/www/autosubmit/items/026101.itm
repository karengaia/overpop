More than 27% of women giving birth were aged 35 years or older, up from 22% in 2000.Prof Turner said a higher proportion of first-time mothers, for whom labour is traditionally longer and more difficult, was another factor in the increase in complex births. The average age of first-time mothers is now 29.1 years.There were four births to girls under the age of 15. Almost one-third of births were to single mothers.The report, by the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI), found our birth rate - the highest in Europe - continues to grow, standing at 76,000 in 2009, up 22,000 on 1999.Delivery by caesarean section continues to become more common, with more than 26% of women delivered by C-section in 2009, compared to 21% in 2000. In 1990, the rate was 11%.Breastfeeding rates continue to rise and are highest among mothers with professional occupations (63.3%).The perinatal mortality rate was 6.9 per 1,000 total births in 2009, down from 8.2 per 1,000 in 1999.Prof Turner said that while the perinatal mortality rate has improved he "would be concerned" that this could change if the quality of maternity services deteriorated because of the growing demands on the service at a time when resources are shrinking."There would be serious consequences if there was any reduction in maternity services," Prof Turner said.Dr Sam Coulter Smith, master of the Rotunda Hospital, has said his hospital is set to go over budget by several million euro this year as it struggles to deal with the rising birth rate.rights reserved.
