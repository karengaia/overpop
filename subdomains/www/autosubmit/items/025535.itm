While it is free from GP surgeries and sexual health clinics, these may not be open at convenient times and locations. In the interests of both individuals and society, providing emergency contraception at no cost is a worthwhile investment if it avoids the much larger costs and disruption of life chances resulting from unintended births and helps to reduce the UK's high abortion rate.FOR FURTHER INFORMATION: See www.populationmatters.org or telephone 020 8123 9116
