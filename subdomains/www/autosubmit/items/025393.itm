Glenn, J. Jed Brown and James W. O’LearyEarth may be the Ocean Planet,but most terrestrial creatures—including humans—depend forfood on plants irrigated by freshwaterfrom rainfall, rivers, lakes, springs andstreams. None of the top ﬁve plants eat-en by people—wheat, corn, rice, pota-toes and soybeans—can tolerate salt: ex-pose them to seawater, and they droop,shrivel and die within days.One of the most urgent global prob-lems is ﬁnding enough water and landto support the world’s food needs. TheUnited Nations Food and AgricultureOrganization estimates that an addition-al 200 million hectares (494.2 millionacres) of new cropland—an areathe size of Arizona, New Mex-ico, Utah, Colorado, Idaho,Wyoming and MontanaGLASSWORT SPECIES (here, Salicorniabigelovii) usually grow in coastal marsh-es. Because of their ability to ﬂourish insaltwater, glasswort plants are the mostpromising crop to be grown so far usingseawater irrigation along coastal deserts.They can be eaten by livestock, and theirseeds yield a nutty-tasting oil.76Scientific AmericanAugust 1998Copyright 1998 Scientific American, Inc.combined—will be needed over the next30 years just to feed the burgeoning pop-ulations of the tropics and subtropics.Yet only 93 million hectares are avail-able in these nations for farms to ex-pand—and much of that land is forest-ed and should be preserved. Clearly, weneed alternative sources of water andland on which to grow crops.With help from our colleagues, wehave tested the feasibility of seawateragriculture and have found that it workswell in the sandy soils of desert environ-ments. Seawater agriculture is deﬁned asgrowing salt-tolerant crops on land us-ing water pumped from the ocean forirrigation. There is no shortage of sea-water: 97 percent of the water on earthis in the oceans. Desert land is alsoplentiful: 43 percent of the earth’s to-tal land surface is arid or semiarid,but only a small fraction is closeenough to the sea to make seawaterfarming feasible. We estimate that 15percent of undeveloped land in theworld’s coastal and inland salt desertscould be suitable for growing crops us-ing saltwater agriculture. This amountsto 130 million hectares of new crop-land that could be brought into humanor animal food production—withoutcutting down forests or diverting morescarce freshwater for use in agriculture.Seawater agriculture is an old idea thatwas ﬁrst taken seriously after WorldWar II. In 1949 ecologist Hugo Boykoand horticulturalist Elisabeth Boykowent to the Red Sea town of Eilat dur-ing the formation of the state of Israelto create landscaping that would attractsettlers. Lacking freshwater, the Boykosused a brackish well and seawaterpumped directly from the ocean andshowed that many plants would growbeyond their normal salinity limits insandy soil [see “Salt-Water Agriculture,”by Hugo Boyko; Scientiﬁc American,March 1967]. Although many of theBoykos’ ideas of how plants toleratesalts have not stood the test of time,their work stimulated widespread inter-est, including our own, in extending thesalinity constraints of traditional irri-gated agriculture.Seawater agriculture must fulﬁll tworequirements to be cost-effective. First,it must produce useful crops at yieldshigh enough to justify the expense ofpumping irrigation water from the sea.Second, researchers must develop agro-nomic techniques for growing seawa-ter-irrigated crops in a sustainable man-ner—one that does not damage the en-RICHARD JONESvironment. Clearing these hurdles hasproved a daunting task, but we havehad some success.Salty Cropshe development of seawater agri-culture has taken two directions.Some investigators have attempted tobreed salt tolerance into conventionalcrops, such as barley and wheat. For ex-ample, Emanuel Epstein’s research teamat the University of California at Davisshowed as early as 1979 that strains ofbarley propagated for generations in thepresence of low levels of salt could pro-duce small amounts of grain when irri-gated by comparatively saltier seawater.Unfortunately, subsequent efforts to in-crease the salt tolerance of conventionalcrops through selective breeding andgenetic engineering—in which genes forsalt tolerance were added directly to theplants—have not produced good candi-dates for seawater irrigation. The uppersalinity limit for the long-term irriga-tion of even the most salt-tolerant crops,such as the date palm, is still less thanﬁve parts per 1,000 (ppt)—less than 15percent of the salt content of seawater.Normal seawater is 35 ppt salt, but inwaters along coastal deserts, such asthe Red Sea, the northern Gulf of Cali-fornia (between the western coast ofSonora in Mexico and Baja California)and the Persian Gulf, it is usually closerto 40 ppt. (Sodium chloride, or tablesalt, is the most prevalent salt in seawa-ter and the one that is most harmful toplant growth.)Our approach has been to domesti-cate wild, salt-tolerant plants, calledhalophytes, for use as food, forage andoilseed crops. We reasoned that chang-ing the basic physiology of a traditionalcrop plant from salt-sensitive to salt-tol-erant would be difﬁcult and that it mightbe more feasible to domesticate a wild,salt-tolerant plant. After all, our moderncrops started out as wild plants. Indeed,some halophytes—such as grain from thesaltgrass Distichlis palmeri (Palmer’sgrass)—were eaten for generations bynative peoples, including the Cocopah,who live where the Colorado River emp-ties into the Gulf of California.We began our seawater agriculture ef-forts by collecting several hundred halo-phytes from throughout the world andscreening them for salt tolerance andnutritional content in the laboratory.There are between 2,000 and 3,000 spe-cies of halophytes, from grasses andTCopyright 1998 Scientific American, Inc.Scientific AmericanAugust 199877SEAWATER AGRICULTURE can require different agronomictechniques than freshwater agriculture. To grow saltbush, orAtriplex—a salt-tolerant plant that can be used to feed livestock—seawater farmers must ﬂood their ﬁelds frequently (left). In ad-DAN MURPHYdition, irrigation booms (center) must be lined with plastic pipingto protect them from rusting when in contact with the salty wa-ter. But some techniques can remain the same: standard com-bines are used to harvest Salicornia seeds (right), for example.shrubs to trees such as mangroves; theyoccupy a wide range of habitats—fromwet, seacoast marshes to dry, inland sa-line deserts. In collaboration with DovPasternak’s research team at Ben Guri-on University of the Negev in Israel andethnobotanists Richard S. Felger andNicholas P. Yensen—who were then atthe University of Arizona—we foundroughly a dozen halophytes that showedsufﬁcient promise to be grown underagronomic conditions in ﬁeld trials.In 1978 we began trials of the mostpromising plants in the coastal desert atPuerto Peñasco, on the western coast ofMexico. We irrigated the plants daily byﬂooding the ﬁelds with high-saline (40ppt) seawater from the Gulf of Califor-nia. Because the rainfall at Puerto Peñas-co averages only 90 millimeters a year—and we ﬂooded our plots with an annu-al total depth of 20 meters or more ofseawater—we were certain the plantswere growing almost solely on seawater.(We calculate rainfall and irrigation ac-cording to the depth in meters that fallson the ﬁelds rather than in cubic me-ters, which is a measure of volume.)Although the yields varied amongspecies, the most productive halophytesproduced between one and two kilo-grams per square meter of dry biomass—roughly the yield of alfalfa grown usingfreshwater irrigation. Some of the mostproductive and salt-tolerant halophyteswere shrubby species of Salicornia (glass-wort), Suaeda (sea blite) and Atriplex(saltbush) from the family Chenopodi-aceae, which contains about 20 percent78Scientific Americanof all halophyte species. Salt grasses suchas Distichlis and viny, succulent-leavedground covers such as Batis were alsohighly productive. (These plants are notChenopodiaceae, though; they are mem-bers of the Poaceae and Batidaceae fam-ilies, respectively.)But to fulﬁll the ﬁrst cost-effectivenessrequirement for seawater agriculture,we had to show that halophytes couldreplace conventional crops for a speciﬁcuse. Accordingly, we tested whetherhalophytes could be used to feed live-stock. Finding enough forage for cattle,sheep and goat herds is one of the mostchallenging agricultural problems in theworld’s drylands, 46 percent of whichhave been degraded through overgraz-ing, according to the U.N. EnvironmentProgram. Many halophytes have highlevels of protein and digestible carbohy-drates. Unfortunately, the plants alsocontain large amounts of salt; accumu-lating salt is one of the ways they adjustto a saline environment [see illustrationon page 80]. Because salt has no caloriesyet takes up space, the high salt contentof halophytes dilutes their nutritionalvalue. The high salinity of halophytesalso limits the amount an animal can eat.In open grazing situations, halophytesare usually considered “reserve-browseplants,” to which animals turn onlywhen more palatable plants are gone.Our strategy was to incorporate halo-phytes as part of a mixed diet for live-stock, replacing conventional hay foragewith halophytes to make up between30 and 50 percent of the total food in-take of sheep and goats. (These percent-ages are the typical forage levels used infattening animals for slaughter.) Wefound that animals fed diets containingSalicornia, Suaeda and Atriplex gainedas much weight as those whose diets in-cluded hay. Moreover, the quality of thetest animals’ meat was unaffected bytheir eating a diet rich in halophytes.Contrary to our initial fears, the animalshad no aversion to eating halophytes inmixed diets; they actually seemed to beattracted by the salty taste. But the ani-mals that ate a halophyte-rich diet drankmore water than those that ate hay, tocompensate for the extra salt intake. Inaddition, the feed conversion ratio of thetest animals (the amount of meat theyproduced per kilogram of feed) was 10percent lower than that of animals eat-ing a traditional diet.Farming for Oilhe most promising halophyte wehave found thus far is Salicorniabigelovii. It is a leaﬂess, succulent, annu-al salt-marsh plant that colonizes newareas of mud ﬂat through proliﬁc seedproduction. The seeds contain high lev-els of oil (30 percent) and protein (35percent), much like soybeans and otheroilseed crops, and the salt content is lessthan 3 percent. The oil is highly poly-unsaturated and similar to safﬂower oilin fatty-acid composition. It can be ex-tracted from the seed and reﬁned usingconventional oilseed equipment; it isalso edible, with a pleasant, nutlike tasteTAugust 1998Irrigating Crops with SeawaterCopyright 1998 Scientific American, Inc.seawater-irrigated crop yields dependson the amount of seawater used. Al-though Salicornia can thrive when thesalinity of the water bathing its roots ex-ceeds 100 ppt—roughly three times thenormal saltiness of the ocean—it needsapproximately 35 percent more irriga-tion when grown using seawater thanconventional crops grown using fresh-water. Salicornia requires this extra wa-ter because as it selectively absorbs wa-ter from the seawater, it quickly rendersthe remaining seawater too salty for use.DAN MURPHYMaking It Payand a texture similar to olive oil. A smalldrawback is that the seed contains sapo-nins, bitter compounds that make theraw seeds inedible. These do not contam-inate the oil, but they can remain in themeal after oil extraction. The saponinsthus restrict the amount of meal thatcan be used in chicken diets, but feedingtrials have shown that Salicornia seedmeal can replace conventional seedmeals at the levels normally used as aprotein supplement in livestock diets.Hence, every part of the plant is usable.We have participated in building sev-eral prototype Salicornia farms of up to250 hectares in Mexico, the United ArabEmirates, Saudi Arabia and India. Dur-ing six years of ﬁeld trials in Mexico,Salicornia produced an average annualcrop of 1.7 kilograms per square meterof total biomass and 0.2 kilogram persquare meter of oilseed. These yieldsequal or exceed the yields of soybeans2.0BIOMASS YIELD(KILOGRAMS PER METER SQUARED PER YEAR)1.5and other oilseeds grown using freshwa-ter irrigation. We have also shown thatnormal farm and irrigation equipmentcan be modiﬁed so that it is protectedfrom salt damage from the seawater. Al-though the irrigation strategies for han-dling seawater are different from thoseused for freshwater crops, we have notencountered any insurmountable engi-neering problems in scaling up from ﬁeldtests to prototype farms.Normally, crops are irrigated onlywhen the soil dries to about 50 percentof its ﬁeld capacity, the amount of wa-ter it is capable of holding. In addition,in freshwater irrigation, farmers addonly enough water to replace what theplants have used. In contrast, seawaterirrigation requires copious and fre-quent—even daily—irrigation to pre-vent salt from building up in the rootzone to a level that inhibits growth.Our ﬁrst ﬁeld trials used far more wa-ter (20 meters a year) than could be ap-plied economically, so in 1992 we be-gan experiments to determine the mini-mum amount of seawater irrigationneeded to produce a good yield. Wegrew test plantings of Salicornia in soilboxes buried within open, irrigated plotsof the same crop during two years ofﬁeld trials. The boxes, called lysimeters,had bottom drains that conveyed excesswater to several collection points outsidethe plots, allowing us to measure thevolume and salinity of the drain water.Using them, we calculated the waterand salt balances required for a seawa-ter-irrigated crop for the ﬁrst time. Wefound that the amount of biomass aan seawater agriculture be econom-ical? The greatest expense in irri-gated agriculture is in pumping the wa-ter. The pumping costs are directly pro-portional to the amount of waterpumped and the height to which it islifted. Although halophytes require morewater than conventional crops, seawa-ter farms near sea level require less wa-ter lifting than conventional farms,which often lift water from wells deep-er than 100 meters. Because pumpingseawater at sea level is cheaper thanpumping freshwater from wells, seawa-ter agriculture should be cost-effectivein desert regions—even though its yieldsare smaller than traditional, freshwateragriculture.Seawater irrigation does not requirespecial equipment. The large test farmswe have helped build have used eitherﬂood irrigation of large basins or mov-ing-boom sprinkler irrigation.

For seawater use, a plasticpipe is inserted in the boom so the sea-water does not contact metal. Salicorniaseeds have also been successfully har-vested using ordinary combines set tomaximize retention of the very smallseeds, which are only roughly one milli-gram in weight.Yet Salicornia, our top success storyso far, is not a perfect crop. The plantstend to lodge (lie ﬂat in the ﬁeld) as har-vest approaches, and the seeds may shat-ter (release before harvest). In addition,seed recoveries are only about 75 per-cent for Salicornia, compared withgreater than 90 percent for most crops.Further, to support high seed yields Sal-icornia must grow for approximately100 days at cool temperatures beforeﬂowering. Currently production of thiscrop is restricted to the subtropics,which have cool winters and hot sum-mers; however, some of the largest ar-eas of coastal desert in the world are inthe comparatively hotter tropics.The second cost-effectiveness require-ment of seawater agriculture is sustain-ability over the long term. But sustain-ability is not a problem limited to irri-gation using seawater: in fact, many ir-rigation projects that use freshwatercannot pass the sustainability test. Inarid regions, freshwater irrigation is of-ten practiced in inland basins with re-stricted drainage, resulting in the build-up of salt in the water tables underneaththe ﬁelds. Between 20 and 24 percent ofthe world’s freshwater-irrigated landssuffer from salt and water buildup in theroot zone. When the problem becomessevere, farmers must install expensivesubsurface drainage systems; disposingof the collected drain water creates ad-ditional problems. In California’s SanJoaquin Valley, for example, wastewaterthat had drained into a wetland causeddeath and deformity in waterfowl be-cause of the toxic effects of selenium,an element that typically occurs in manywestern U.S. soils but had built up tohigh concentrations in the drain water.Seawater agriculture is not necessarilyexempt from such problems, but it doesoffer some advantages. First, coastal des-ert farms on sandy soils generally haveunimpeded drainage back to the sea.We have continuously irrigated the sameﬁelds with seawater for over 10 yearswith no buildup of water or salts in theroot zone. Second, coastal and inlandsalt desert aquifers often already haveelevated concentrations of salt and soshould not be damaged by seawater.Third, the salt-affected soils that wepropose for seawater agriculture are of-ten barren—or nearly so—to start with,so installing a seawater farm may havefar less effect on sensitive ecosystemsthan conventional agriculture does.No farming activity is completelybenign, however. Large-scale coastalshrimp farms, for example, have causedalgal blooms and disease problems inrivers or bays that receive their nutri-ent-rich efﬂuent [see “Shrimp Aquacul-ture and the Environment,” by ClaudeE. Boyd and Jason W. Clay; ScientiﬁcAmerican, June]. A similar problemcan be anticipated from large-scale halo-phyte farms, caused by the large vol-ume of high-salt drainage water con-taining unused fertilizer, which will ulti-mately be discharged back to the sea.On the other hand, seawater farms canalso be part of a solution to this prob-lem if shrimp-farm efﬂuent is recycledonto a halophyte farm instead of dis-Anatomy of a HalophyteSome salt-tolerant plants, or halophytes,have evolved mechanisms at the root, leaf andcell levels for thriving in the presence of seawater.The cells that make up the outer layer, orepidermis, of each rootlet are nearly imperviousto salt (NaCl).

Theﬁrst halophyte test farm we builtin Mexico was installed to recycleshrimp-farm efﬂuent, and furtherresearch linking marine aquacul-ture efﬂuent with halophyte farmsis under way.Halophyte farms have also beenproposed as a way to recycle theselenium-rich agricultural drainwater generated in the San Joa-quin Valley of California. Seleni-um is an essential nutrient at low levelsbut becomes toxic at high levels. Halo-phytes grown on drain water in the val-ley take up enough selenium to makethem useful as animal-feed supplementsSLIM FILMSbut not enough to make them toxic.Will seawater agriculture ever be prac-ticed on a large scale? Our goal in thelate 1970s was to establish the feasibili-ty of seawater agriculture; we expectedto see commercial farming within 10years. Twenty years later seawater agri-culture is still at the prototype stage ofcommercial development. Several com-panies have established halophyte testfarms of Salicornia or Atriplex in Cali-fornia, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Egypt,Pakistan and India; however, to ourknowledge, none have entered large-scale production. Our research experi-ence convinces us of the feasibility ofseawater agriculture. Whether the worldultimately turns to this alternative willdepend on future food needs, economicsand the extent to which freshwaterecosystems are withheld from furtherSAagricultural development.SUNLIGHTSome halophytes, suchas this Atriplex (saltbush),have specialized cellscalled salt bladders ontheir leaves for storingexcess NaCl. When full,the salt bladders burst,releasing salt in a silverylayer that reflects lightand cools the leaf. Watervapor escapes throughpores on the undersidesof the leaves.The AuthorsEDWARD P. GLENN, J. JED BROWN and JAMES W.

Glenn began his research career as a self-described “marine agronomist” in 1978 af-ter receiving his Ph.D. from the University of Hawaii; he is now a professor in the depart-ment of soil, water and environmental science at the University of Arizona at Tucson.
