The trend to implement Performance-based Incentives (PBI) in low- and middle-income countries to
strengthen health systems, accelerate service utilization, and enhance quality of health interventions
presents an opportunity as well as a challenge for voluntary family planning (FP) service delivery and use.
There is considerable opportunity, through PBI, to stimulate quality FP counseling and increase access to
and availability of voluntary FP. At the same time, the challenge of introducing incentives that support
informed voluntary choice requires careful design and ongoing monitoring. This tension should not
cause policymakers to shy away from incorporating FP into PBI schemes, as there is a real danger that
excluding FP from the schemes may result in its neglect. Given the central role FP plays in attainment of
the Millennium Development Goals, appropriate mechanisms to incorporate FP into PBI approaches are
needed. This paper identifies the opportunities as well as the challenges of incorporating FP into PBI
approaches; discusses U.S. policies and support for enhancing access to FP; presents what is known
about how low- and middle-income countries are including FP in PBI approaches and lessons learned;
and provides suggestions for donors, policymakers, program implementers, and technical assistance
providers about how to responsibly and effectively integrate FP into PBI programs in the developing
world.

For those considering introduction of health PBI initiatives, it provides examples of programs that
have successfully incorporated FP.

PBI approaches in health link payment to the achievement of predefined health results. We see
arrangements with payers and recipients at different levels in health systems, each with implications and
trade-offs regarding effectiveness and cost. Donors have incorporated PBI in the way they structure
payment to countries by conditioning aid on evidence of health results and some national governments
transfer funds to sub-national levels of government based partly on attainment of health or coverage
targets. In some fragile state contexts, donors pay nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) for results
that include FP. A number of developing countries reward health facilities for quality counseling and
availability and use of modern FP methods. To reduce financial barriers to accessing FP, some programs
sell to poor women vouchers at subsidized rates that provide access to FP and other services from
accredited providers. Conditional cash transfer (CCT) programs provide income support to poor
families if they meet health and education conditions that, in some cases, include participating in health
education talks about FP.

Because FP contributes to health and broad development goals, the case is strong to include FP as one
of the priorities in PBI approaches. Improvements in FP use results in fewer unintended pregnancies;
fewer maternal and newborn deaths; healthier mothers and children; greater family savings and
productivity; and better prospects for educating children, strengthening economies, and reducing the
pressure on natural resources in developing countries.

By exploring details of a wide range of PBI schemes, this paper looks at how FP has been incorporated,
how recipients are incentivized, impact when available, and lessons that hold relevance for other

XI

settings. PBI schemes were identified through an on-line survey that was conducted in May 2009 and by
schemes known to authors. The paper provides a wide range of program examples, some from
countries that do not receive USAID support. Therefore, USAID-supported PBI programs should
consider the applicability of the U.S. FP requirements if using these examples as a basis to develop PBI
program activities. Paying for performance in FP can be introduced to incentivize actions at various
levels in a health system. The decision about whether to introduce incentives for national-level
recipients (e.g., a ministry of health), health facilities, or individual clients should be determined by goals;
whose actions are needed to attain the goals; and relative costs, benefits, and feasibility of administering
performance payments at various levels. The following cases are discussed:

The regional Health 2015 Mesoamerica Initiative in Central America and Mexico and
State Innovations in Family Planning Agency in India that describe approaches that link
funding from donors to national- or state-level recipients to FP results.

The maternal and child health insurance program for the poor in Argentina, federal to
municipal fiscal transfers in Brazil, and incentives from national to facility levels in a pilot in
Zambia describe approaches that link funding from national to sub-national levels linked to FP
results.

Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, Liberia, and Southern Sudan
incorporate FP indicators into their PBI approaches that contract NGOs to directly deliver services
and/or oversee service delivery in a geographic area.

Voucher schemes in Pakistan and Kenya include coupons to access FP services and incorporate
incentives on both the demand and supply side.

PBI are used to motivate community health workers to identify pregnant women, provide
counseling to women, families, and their communities, and recognize where FP demand is unmet in
India and the Philippines.

Since 1997, seven countries in Latin America and the Caribbean (Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador,
Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, and Nicaragua) have implemented and evaluated CCT programs
with health and nutrition components, many including FP.

Many of these cases demonstrate that FP can be incorporated into PBI schemes in ways that protect
voluntary choice and are in compliance with U.S. FP requirements.

Box ES-1 summarizes best practices to consider when designing a PBI scheme that incorporates FP.

This paper encourages the inclusion of voluntary FP within PBI programs supported by USAID or taking
place in USAID-supported health facilities in a manner consistent with USAID FP requirements. The
paper clarifies these requirements and provides examples of USAID-supported PBI programs where
voluntary FP is included in a manner that is consistent with the requirements.

As donors embrace the principles of country-led health plans, complemented by increased accountability
for results, linking payment to performance is likely to increase in prominence. We may see more
performance-based aid, as donors condition payment to countries based on results. We may also see an
increase in national to sub-national PBI as governments exercise their influence through conditions
attached to intergovernmental fiscal transfers. At the national and sub-national levels, rewarding

population-level FP services coverage targets (for example, proportion of women of reproductive age in
a province using FP) as well as their quality is consistent with U.S. FP requirements.

Box ES-1: Best Practices to Consider When Including Voluntary FP in PBI Programs:
"Dos and Don'ts"

Individual client level:
1. Do consider offering clients the opportunity to purchase coupons/vouchers (at full or subsidized prices) for a
package of services that includes FP. Client payments for the purchase of vouchers promote voluntary FP
choice and acceptance and can enable clients to receive services from providers they prefer, either public or
private.
2. Do consider reducing financial barriers for voluntary sterilization clients to make the method readily accessible
by subsidizing the cost of the procedure or offering reasonable compensation or in-kind support to those
experiencing high service delivery costs, lost wages during convalescence, high transportation costs to reach a
facility, or who require food during confinement.
3. Do consider offering compensation to offset the costs of transportation to enable clients to attend health
education sessions and to receive FP counseling.
4. Do include attendance in health education sessions that discuss FP as one of the conditions of CCT programs.
5. Don't pay clients or give them any benefits in exchange for accepting a method.
6. Don't deny clients a benefit if they choose not to accept FP.

Individual health worker level:
1. Do consider paying health providers for FP services that include quality counseling as well as provision of a
method. Payment should be reasonable, where "reasonable" implies payments that are in line with payments
for other services. This includes compensation for services delivered to voucher clients.
2. Don't reward health providers for achieving a target number of FP users or users of a particular FP method.
3. Don't compensate for delivery of specific FP methods with payments that are out of line with payments for
other services, as this may lead to coercive behavior.

Health facility, health team, or NGO level:
1. Do consider rewarding the availability of a wide range of methods.
2. Do consider rewarding facilities or teams to attain performance objectives. Health facility or team targets or
goals should not be distributed to health care providers as individual targets. Consider rewarding facilities or
teams to attain performance objectives specified as number of clients counseled, or number of new FP clients
accepting FP methods. Please note: health facilities and teams have more than one health worker. For facilities
with one health worker, refer to the guidelines for individual health workers.
3. Do include FP counseling as a component of antenatal and postnatal care indicators.
4. Do reward performance indicators that combine FP services provided and measures of FP quality.
5. Don't compensate for delivery of specific FP methods with payments that are out of line with payments for
other services, as this may lead to coercive behavior.

Sub-national or national level:
1. Do consider opportunities to link fiscal transfers from national to sub-national levels of government to results
related to population coverage of specific methods, counseling and education, improved quality, and increased
access.

The trend to implement Performance-based Incentives (PBI) in low- and middle-income countries to
strengthen health systems, accelerate service utilization, and enhance quality of health interventions
presents an opportunity as well as a challenge for voluntary family planning (FP). The opportunity,
through PBI, to stimulate quality FP counseling and increase access to and availability of voluntary FP is
considerable. At the same time, the challenge of introducing incentives that support informed choice
requires careful design and ongoing monitoring. This tension should not cause policymakers to shy away
from incorporating FP into PBI schemes, as there is a real danger that excluding FP may result in its
neglect. Given the central role voluntary FP plays in attainment of the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs), appropriate mechanisms to incorporate voluntary FP into PBI approaches are needed. This
paper identifies the opportunities as well as the challenges of incorporating FP into PBI approaches;
discusses U.S. policies and support for enhancing access to voluntary FP; presents what is known about
how low- and middle-income countries are including FP and lessons learned; and provides suggestions
for donors, policymakers, program implementers, and technical assistance providers about how to
responsibly and effectively integrate voluntary FP into PBI programs in the developing world.

A formal definition of PBI for health is: “Transfer of money or material goods conditional on taking a
measurable health-related action or achieving a predetermined performance target."1 Essentially, PBI
approaches link a payment to the achievement of predefined and agreed-upon results. This might mean
providing income support to poor households with conditions that specify that they attend health
education sessions that discuss FP or it might be a program that helps poor women overcome financial
obstacles to seeking counseling or services by providing payment for transportation. It might mean
payments to health facilities if the team working at the facility succeeds in providing quality FP counseling
and services to the specified portion of the population they serve. PBI may also be incorporated into the
way national governments transfer funds to sub-national levels of government, with partial links to
attainment of health or coverage targets that include FP. Donors have also used PBI in the way they
structure payment to countries and links to FP results can be incorporated.

Why has interest in PBI intensified recently? Global commitment to achieve the health MDGs is one of
the drivers behind interest in PBI as countries recognize that current health system strengthening/health
financing approaches will not produce desired results. Optimism has resulted from evaluations of
conditional cash transfer (CCT) schemes in Latin America that demonstrate that linking income
transfers to health and education conditions can produce encouraging results (Glassman et al. 2009,
Regalia and Castro 2009). Supply-side schemes that link payment to service delivery nongovernmental
organizations (NGOs) to achievement of results in Afghanistan (Sondorp et al. 2009) and Haiti (Eichler
et al. 2009) are also promising. A recent rigorous evaluation of the impact of the now scaled-up national
approach in Rwanda suggests that PBI contributes to improvements in service utilization and quality,
including new and continuing use of FP (Basinga et al. April 2009). This growing body of evidence adds to

1

the common sense appeal of PBI as a complement to the training and investment in inputs that has been
much of the focus on health system strengthening in recent decades.

PBI is especially useful in health services environments where the existing incentives do not elicit hard
work and where bureaucratic systems thwart individual initiative. Linking a portion of payment to
achieving health results and, at the same time, allowing recipients the flexibility and autonomy to
respond to incentives may catalyze actions that overcome many health system weaknesses. For example,
civil service structures in many developing countries provide relatively low fixed salaries that do not vary
if a health worker is a stellar performer or a bad one. Add to this that people lose their jobs only for
serious misconduct and the result is a weak incentive environment for the most internally driven and an
outright dysfunctional incentive environment for most others. NGOs are often paid for documented
spending on inputs, rather than for producing results. A shift to accountability for results by a payment
system that rewards results can stimulate changes in the behaviors of institutions and the individuals that
work within them. Intergovernmental transfers can be powerful levers to catalyze accountability for
results and the systems to achieve results at sub-national levels of government.

Rewarding FP results through PBI approaches involves more complex behaviors by clients and service
providers than rewards for services that are more time limited and subject to less complex social, intra-
household, and community dynamics, such as child immunization and vitamin A supplementation. For
clients, the decision to seek counseling for FP, followed by choice of a method and its continued use,
requires a complex series of behaviors and actions that include appreciation of the benefits of FP,
support from families and communities, repeated actions to use the chosen method, and the ability to
overcome barriers to accessing services. Incentives can overcome financial access barriers and
strengthen understanding and perceived value by rewarding participation in health education talks. On
the service provision side, providers need to deliver quality counseling, ensure availability of
commodities, and have the technical competence to deliver chosen methods. Performance incentives
can increase availability of FP counseling and methods and have the potential to improve quality.

Because incentives can be a potentially powerful tool, it is critical to consider the purpose of the
incentives and monitor unintended consequences as well as those intended. Potential pitfalls of PBI
programs related to voluntary FP include the following:

Providers may focus on rewarded services and neglect other important services. PBI schemes that
leave out FP may find that providers neglect provision of voluntary FP services, contributing to
stagnating FP use, while the use of other rewarded services rises.

Poorly designed PBI incentives may result in excessive attention to increasing voluntary FP use,
resulting in coercive behavior by managers and providers that interferes with voluntary choice by
clients.

PBI may damage the intrinsic motivation of providers and cause them to view health care delivery,
including provision of FP services, as piece work.

The quality of information systems may be compromised as the incentives to report the FP results
for which providers are rewarded may cause them to falsify reported information.

Without clear communication, clients may incorrectly interpret the offer to cover transportation
costs to access counseling or specific services (e.g., voluntary sterilization) as payment to accept a
method.

These potential pitfalls can be mitigated with smart design and ongoing monitoring and assessment of
both intended and unintended effects.

Many PBI schemes in developing countries, some mature and others in the early phases of design or
implementation, are currently rewarding improved FP results. Evidence presented in this paper comes
from the authors' knowledge of schemes and from responses to a recent on-line survey that identified
eight programs (some countries have multiple approaches) that incorporate FP indicators and 17 that
include low contraceptive use as a “health concern targeted by the PBI intervention" (Beith et al. 2009).
A wide range of approaches are being tried such as:

Women are sold vouchers by voucher distributors at subsidized rates that enable them to access
FP services at private and/or public facilities (e.g., in Kenya, Pakistan).

NGOs are contracted to provide services and rewarded to reduce FP discontinuation, increase FP
utilization and, in some cases, improve quality of services (e.g., in Bangladesh, Burundi, Democratic
Republic of Congo, Haiti, Kenya, Pakistan, Rwanda).

Public sector providers receive money when FP measures, such as new and continuing FP use, are
achieved (e.g., in Burundi, DR Congo, Egypt, Kenya, Pakistan, Rwanda, Zambia)

Fiscal transfers from national to sub-national levels of government are linked to FP performance
(Argentina, Brazil) and funding from donors to countries is partly conditioned on FP results
(regional initiative in Central America and Mexico, India)

Community health workers are rewarded for ensuring that women receive a comprehensive
package of maternal health services that include FP counseling (India, Philippines).

Section 2 presents the importance of voluntary FP in health and development. Section 3 discusses U.S.
FP requirements and presents a brief history of the development of both Policy Determination 3 and
Addendum: USAID Policy Guidelines on Voluntary Sterilization (PD-3) and the Tiahrt Amendment. Section 4
presents a framework to organize PBI approaches that include voluntary FP and shares snapshots of
these approaches that include program goals, indicators, payment approaches, and results, when
available. Section 5 concludes the paper with a call for new measures that enable rewards for quality FP
counseling and service provision as well as the quantity measures in predominant use and reiterates the
call to include voluntary FP in PBI schemes. By providing clarity on the challenges and opportunities of
PBI for voluntary FP, we hope to offer some strategies on how to most effectively move forward to
incorporate FP indicators into PBI approaches in a manner that ensures voluntarism and informed
choice. An annex is included that presents an overview of the history of support for voluntary FP in the
United States with an eye toward identifying lessons relevant for FP programs in developing countries.

2. CONTRIBUTION OF FP TO
ACHIEVING THE HEALTH MDGS

FP is an important vehicle for advancing maternal and child health and contributes to overall
development. Evidence supporting investments in FP combined with significant global unmet need,
motivated creation of MDG 5b, which calls for universal access to reproductive health and incorporates
FP goals of increasing contraceptive prevalence rates, reducing adolescent birth rates, and satisfying
unmet need for FP. Increased FP use results in fewer unintended pregnancies; fewer maternal and
newborn deaths; healthier mothers and children; greater family savings and productivity; and better
prospects for educating children, strengthening economies, and reducing the pressure on natural
resources in developing countries. Because of these far-reaching benefits, increased investment in FP and
maternal and newborn health services has the potential to accelerate progress toward achieving the
MDGs by 2015. Using estimates from 2008, a recent report, Adding It Up (Singh et al. 2009) shows that:

Despite increases in FP use in recent years, an estimated 215 million women who want to avoid a
pregnancy are not using an effective method of contraception;

About 20 million women have unsafe abortions each year, and 3 million of the estimated 8.5 million
who need care for subsequent health complications, do not receive it.

The direct health benefits of meeting the need for FP and maternal and newborn health services would
also be dramatic. It is estimated that, if this need were met:

Unintended pregnancies would drop by more than two-thirds, from 75 million in 2008 to 22 million
per year.

Forty-four percent of newborn deaths would be averted  a decline from 3.5 million to 1.9 million.

Unsafe abortions would decline by 73 percent, from 20 million to 5.5 million (assuming no change
in abortion laws), and the number of women needing medical care for complications of unsafe
procedures would decline from 8.5 million to 2 million.

More women would survive hemorrhage and infection, and fewer would endure needless suffering
from fistula, infertility, and other health problems related to pregnancy or childbirth.

While the benefits of increasing access to FP information and services are clear, is also clear that
continuing with “business as usual" will not fill the need gap. This is true for a range of priority health
interventions in addition to FP. One promising solution that a number of countries are using to
strengthen health systems is PBI supply- and demand-side incentive approaches of various forms. This
paper hopes to shed light on “What is PBI and how are countries, in particular developing countries,
using it to increase access to FP in a way that ensures voluntarism and informed choice?"

3. USAID FP POLICIES RELATED TO
VOLUNTARISM AND INFORMED
CHOICE

This section covers the statutes and policies of the United States Agency for International Development
(USAID) that most directly pertain to PBI schemes and the motivations behind their enactment. It begins
with a bit of the history that motivated introduction of policies in 1982 that provided guidance on how
USAID funding should be used to support informed consent and protect voluntarism. These policies
were further elaborated within U.S. statutes in 1998 to clarify standards that protect client voluntary
choice. Including voluntary FP within a USAID-supported PBI program can be acceptable if it takes care
to ensure compliance with the 1998 Tiahrt Amendment and respects voluntarism and informed choice
of FP services. This has been done successfully in a number of cases, many described in the pages that
follow. Understanding these rules and the history behind them is relevant to all who wish to protect
voluntarism.

In the early years of national FP programs, some developing countries, notably Bangladesh and India,
introduced incentive payments for both providers and individuals for surgical sterilization. Payments to
providers were designed to overcome provider resistance to offering FP services, especially voluntary
sterilization, and encourage increases in availability of all FP services. Payments to compensate for travel
costs and the value of lost wages during the recovery period were also made to individual clients who
received voluntary surgical sterilization. At the time, voluntary sterilization services were offered in only
a relatively few sites and, given that it was a surgical procedure, required several days of convalescence.

The practice of rewarding providers for achieving specific contraceptive targets, especially for such a
permanent and provider-dependent method as sterilization, created serious concerns that payments
could lead providers to coerce clients to accept specific contraceptive methods, notably sterilization.
Such concerns were voiced by supporters of organized FP assistance (see Cleland and Mauldin 1991) as
well as by its critics (cf. Hartman 1985; Warwick 1982). Provider payments for sterilization were also
thought to bias the presentation of information about sterilization in comparison with other methods.
However, there is little evidence supporting the concern that such compensation schemes have
promoted reliance on sterilization. Indeed, one of the countries whose sterilization practices were most
criticized, Bangladesh, has in fact seen a steady decline in sterilization use despite the persistence of both
provider and client reimbursement for the service (see EngenderHealth 2002, p. 5-6).

To ensure the practice of informed consent and to protect voluntarism in the provision of sterilization
services, USAID introduced agency policy in 1982: Policy Determination 3 and Addendum: USAID Policy
Guidelines on Voluntary Sterilization.2 PD-3 lays out agency guidelines on a number of issues, including
payments related to voluntary sterilization. The addendum clarifies PD-3 and elaborates detailed
program guidelines regarding acceptable practice for payment of acceptors, payment of providers of
services, and “payment of referral agents." The paper establishes that payments per case or per
procedure to providers of voluntary sterilization services are acceptable if the payments are
“reasonable." While acknowledging the acceptability of the practice (given the “customary" nature of

7

reimbursement for health procedures), the document advises USAID missions to “encourage patterns of
service delivery and methods of payment which do not unduly emphasize voluntary sterilization services
compared to other methods of ‘fertility control.'" PD-3 specifically mentions several measures for
mitigating the risk of such payments functioning as incentives. These include separating the selection and
counseling of clients from the provision of the service and structuring reimbursement for providers of
FP “per counseling session" rather than for acceptance of a specific method.

Policy and practice regarding the acceptability of payments to FP providers continued to be guided solely
by PD-3 until the late 1990s. In October 1998, members of Congress responded to evidence of non-
voluntary practices in the Peruvian FP program with the introduction of a statutory amendment, known
as the “Tiahrt Amendment." The Tiahrt Amendment reaffirms and further elaborates standards for
voluntary FP service delivery programs to protect FP “acceptors," defined as individual clients receiving
services. Statute language has consistently been enacted unchanged in subsequent annual appropriations
legislation to date. Two provisions of the Tiahrt Amendment are directly relevant to PBI in USAID-
funded projects:3

1) Service providers or referral agents shall not implement or be subject to numerical targets or
quotas of total number of births, number of FP acceptors, or acceptors of a particular FP method.
Quantitative estimates or indicators used for budgeting or planning purposes are permissible.

2) No incentives, bribes, gratuities, or financial reward for FP program personnel for achieving targets
or quotas, or for individuals in exchange for becoming a FP acceptor.

The amendment requires that, within 60 days after the USAID Administrator determines that a single
violation of either of these requirements has occurred, the Administrator must submit a report to
Congress describing the violation and corrective actions taken to address it.4

The Tiahrt Amendment enjoys bipartisan support. To ensure voluntarism in its programs, including
compliance with the Tiahrt Amendment, USAID stepped up its internal training on all U.S. FP
requirements and enhanced monitoring of compliance with all statutes and policies that guide its FP
program. To date, three Tiahrt Amendment violations have been reported to Congress by USAID.
Heightened awareness of the statutes and policies, including the Tiahrt Amendment, strong Agency
emphasis on voluntarism, and limited knowledge of PBI as a new way of doing business have initially
combined to create hesitation to include FP in such schemes by those who want to ensure voluntarism
within USAID's FP programs and compliance with the Tiahrt Amendment requirements.

More recently, momentum is building to support health system strengthening interventions that enhance
priority health programs. A number of USAID-supported programs are incorporating innovative
financing approaches such as PBI to strengthen health systems and improve provider and program
performance. There is also a greater understanding of how PBI initiatives can be operationalized and
potential results, building on recent (yet limited) evaluations and reporting of results of PBI initiatives,
growing experience developing PBI programs, greater support for health system strengthening, and new
openness to innovation.

U.S. FP requirements, including the Tiahrt Amendment, offer wide opportunities for including voluntary
FP with PBI initiatives. PBI programs funded or carried out in USAID-supported service delivery projects
must not include provider- or referral-level targets for number of FP acceptors or acceptors of specific
FP methods and demand-side PBI initiatives must not provide benefits in exchange for accepting FP

The full text of the Tiahrt Amendment appears in http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/pop/fy99lang.pdf

methods, but many other options remain for successfully incorporating FP indicators and activities in PBI
initiatives. For example, incentives can be linked to ensuring availability of a choice of modern methods
or for quality counseling. Fee-for-service provider payments linked to provision of voluntary FP services
are also feasible, provided that they are in line with fees for other services. Subsidies to cover clients'
costs of transportation are possible, as long as payment for transportation is not linked to acceptance of
a method and free services can be provided. PBI initiatives have wide latitude for including FP indicators
and activities to increase demand for voluntary FP services. PBI programs often include related behavior
change communication and information, education and communication activities where FP messages
should be included to increase information and demand for voluntary FP. Technical assistance activities
within PBI initiatives should also include modules on ensuring FP voluntarism and informed choice within
high-quality, client-centered health services

Box 1: Guidance for USAID Missions, Contractors, and Recipients of USAID FP Assistance

Familiarization with current U.S. FP requirements and related guidance is easy and should be the first step in
building compliance into PBI program design. The USAID external web site provides links to the policy language
that governs the use of FP assistance and outlines USAID's guiding principles:
http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/pop/index.html#.

The USAID external web site also includes a link to two specific guidance documents related to the Tiahrt
Amendment: “Guidance for Implementing the ‘Tiahrt' Requirements for Voluntary Family Planning Projects" and
“Technical Guidance on the ‘Comprehensible Information' Paragraph of the Tiahrt Clause."

In addition, USAID's Global Health E-Learning Center, www.globalhealthlearning.org, includes an e-learning
course on the U.S. FP requirements. This publicly available course includes information on all the U.S. FP
requirements, including the Tiahrt Amendment.

USAID Missions should keep communication lines open with implementing partners in order to address questions
or issues that may arise during PBI program development or implementation. USAID Mission staff are strongly
encouraged to contact their Regional Legal Advisor (RLA), and/or the Senior Policy Advisor (GH/PRH) at
USAID/Washington, for further assistance addressing compliance or other policy-related questions.

4. FP IN PBI SCHEMES IN DEVELOPING
COUNTRIES

The authors are aware of many developing country health PBI schemes that include FP as an important
element, often within a package of maternal health services. We see schemes that are fully private, fully
public, and those that involve partnerships between public and private sectors. While most have been
introduced within the past few years, some have been implemented for much longer. And while many
begin with pilots, others are being introduced at scale, and still others have expanded to scale after
promising pilot results. The vast majority involve supply-side incentives and a few also incorporate
demand-side incentives aimed at overcoming financial obstacles poor women face or increasing
understanding of FP benefits. This section will describe how these schemes work and, where available,
present impact on measures of FP. Also highlighted are pitfalls, challenges, and lessons that can be of
interest to others planning to introduce a FP component to an already existing or planned health sector
PBI scheme.

While this section presents descriptions of how FP is being incorporated in PBI schemes, these
examples should not be considered examples of “best practices," nor are they intended to be used to
guide programs that USAID Missions may adopt. They present evidence of “what is" and not necessarily
“what should be." As programs evolve, we can expect to continue to learn about new innovative
approaches.

Table 1 presents a snapshot of PBI programs in developing countries that incorporate FP, by region. A
more detailed discussion of schemes by category follows.

The following discussion categorizes developing-country PBI schemes that include FP by type of payer
and primary recipient of the performance-based payment. This structure provides a way to organize the
evidence as well as provides a menu of options to consider. There are cases of external donors funding
countries, sub-national levels of government, and NGOs based on performance related to a package of
services that includes FP. We also see transfers from national to sub-national levels of government
partly linked to FP results. There are a number of examples of payment from a government or health
insurer to health facilities and to community health workers linked to attainment of health results that
include FP. We also see a few examples of demand-side PBI, in which funds are provided to clients to

11

Within each category, we provide as much information as we have about the goals of the program
including the justification for paying incentives to the chosen recipients. We describe features of the
design such as indicators, payment rules, and how performance is monitored and validated. Following
discussion of the design elements, we describe what we know about implementation arrangements: the
“how" and “who." When available, we also include results and lessons learned.

4.1. PBA FROM EXTERNAL FUNDER TO NATIONAL OR SUB-
NATIONAL LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT

Performance-based Aid (PBA), which provides funding from an external donor to a national or sub-
national level of government conditional on achieved results, embodies assumptions that incentives at
this “higher" level will catalyze changes in leadership, planning, management, and systems that will result
in improved health and, specifically, FP results. The evidence on the effectiveness of PBA, however, is far
from clear, partly because incentives provided at this higher level do not appear to trickle down to affect
behaviors of providers and clients (Eichler and Glassman 2008).

A new initiative that will include FP was in the design stage when this paper was being written. Health
2015 Mesoamerica, funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Instituto Carlos Slim de la
Salud and managed by the Inter-American Development Bank, aims to avoid weaknesses observed with
other examples of PBA that failed to ensure that incentives change behaviors where change is most

needed  at the level of the service delivery-client interface.5 Payments to governments in Central
America and poor states of Mexico will be linked partly to results that will include FP if FP is a selected
priority of the national or state government that is the potential recipient of performance awards.
Contracts between Health 2015 Mesoamerica and country and state governments intend to specify that
incentives must be transferred to lower levels of the system. While contract terms and actual indicators
are not yet determined, this approach has the potential for much cross-country learning within the
Central American region and beyond. It is also planned to be an interesting model of donor funding
linked to country-level performance that incorporates a contractual requirement that specifies that
incentives reach the service delivery-client interface.

In India, USAID has implemented a form of PBA termed “performance-based disbursement," which
provides funding to a state-level registered society (Indian parastatal) linked to attainment of specified
benchmarks. The State Innovations in Family Planning Agency (SIFPSA) was formed to receive USAID
funding ($325 million over the first 10 years beginning in 1994) and to implement state-level FP activities
in Uttar Pradesh aimed at reducing fertility by expanding access to and improving quality of FP services
(Rowan 2009). In 2002, SIFPSA grew to serve Uttarakhand and Jharkhand and to cover a broader set of
maternal and child health activities. SIFPSA's responsibility is to develop plans to increase FP access, use,
and quality and to contract a range of public and private entities to implement activities.

During the initial phase of development, SIFPSA received support to establish itself as a functioning
organization. Early benchmarks were related to priorities such as development of management systems
and procedures, planning, and staffing. Ongoing benchmarks related to process measures such as
“number of people trained," “NGO contracted and funds disbursed," “development of a media
campaign," and “introduce quality improvement systems" as well as to measures of FP use through
mechanisms such as social franchising. Each benchmark in the annual plan is costed and associated funds
are disbursed after the benchmark is achieved. The majority of the measures are process oriented. In
some contracts, SIFPSA incorporates financial incentives to reward the results the subcontracted entity
is accountable to achieve.

PERFORMANCE-BASED FISCAL TRANSFERS FROM
NATIONAL TO SUB-NATIONAL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT

National governments can incorporate PBI into the methods used to determine transfers of federal
funds to states and municipalities. This may be especially useful in settings where top-down approaches
to health are not feasible due to factors such as sheer size of countries (e.g., India) or decentralization
that transfers responsibility for health to sub-national levels of government. By linking federal-to-state
fiscal transfers to results, national governments can exert influence by providing incentives to hold lower
levels of government accountable while preserving the principle of direct management of health at the
state level. Effective performance-based fiscal transfers can stimulate state health leaders to identify and
fix systemic weaknesses and bottlenecks. If not carefully designed and implemented, however,
performance-based transfers can have the same challenges as PBA described above. If the incentives do
not translate into health-improving actions at the interface between providers and clients, performance-
based inter-governmental transfers will have little impact.

In Argentina, the federal government transfers funds to provinces partly based on enrollment in a
maternal and child health insurance program, Plan Nacer, and partly based on achievement of 10 tracer
indicators, one of which is counseling for sexual and reproductive health. The goals of this program are
to reduce the infant and maternal mortality rate; strengthen the incentive framework for efficiency and
enhance focus on results between the national level and participating provinces and between provinces
and service providers; and strengthen the stewardship capacity of national and provincial ministries of
health. Plan Nacer began as a World Bank project in 2002 with intentions to transition to full
government funding.

After signing an annual performance agreement with the National Ministry of Health, provinces
implement a system to enroll beneficiaries, and design and implement a health service purchasing
function in the Provincial Ministry of Health. Annual performance agreements specify yearly results and
enrollment goals, targets for tracers, prices for services, annual work programs, and yearly projected
budgets. Provinces negotiate quarterly targets, expressed as a proportion of the total eligible population,
with the National Ministry of Health. Each province sets up a “provincial purchasing unit" to oversee
implementation of Plan Nacer at the province level. The responsibilities of the provincial purchasing unit
are to (i) identify and enroll beneficiaries; (ii) identify, authorize, and contract with service providers, (iii)
control the technical quality of services, financial management, and procurement, and (iv) obtain
technical financial and administrative support.

Plan Nacer covers a benefits package that includes 80 health services that improve maternal and child
health. Of the per capita payment of roughly $10 per person/per month (the average cost of providing
the defined package of benefits), 60 percent is transferred based on submission of enrollment lists that
show numbers of poor women and children enrolled in the scheme and the remaining 40 percent is
linked to evidence of achievement on 10 performance targets, with the FP-related target “proportion of
reproductive age women that receive sexual and reproductive care consultations." Achievement of each
target is linked to 4 percent (4 * 10 = 40%).

As in all approaches that link funding to evidence of results, an effective system to monitor and validate
reported results is critical. In Argentina's Plan Nacer program, enrollment of the target population is
crosschecked by examining enrollment registers of other social insurance schemes. Penalties for
misreporting enrollment are return of the per capita transfer plus an additional 20 percent penalty.

Provinces collect and report output information for each tracer, following explicit guidelines from the
national program (and assistance to build the required information, verification, and reporting systems).
An external auditor examines a sample of registrations (enrollment and tracers) for verification. The
National Ministry of Health also conducts a concurrent audit using internal staff.

By 2009, Plan Nacer enrolled 80 percent of the target population in five states (1 million enrollees in
2009). Performance on tracers surpassed targets for six out of 10 indicators.

Plan Nacer is an exciting and innovative program that expands coverage and access to services by poor
women and children by subsidizing premiums in a targeted social insurance program, specifying the rules
for transfers of funds from national to province level, and creating health purchasers at the province
level who negotiate with and pay providers for a defined list of services. However, the devil is in the
details and the implementation “machinery" needs attention. The details to validate data and hold
provinces accountable are critical: The 60 percent transfer upon enrollment ended up building up large
pools of funds in the provincial account. This growing pool then became a source of political pressure as
the national government, the press, and civil society organizations quickly began pressuring provinces to
spend this money on services for enrolled beneficiaries.6 In addition, this strategy enables the central
government to have influence over health in provinces that are decentralized providing a clear oversight
and guidance role for the Ministry of Health while still transferring control over resources and local-
level decisions to the provinces. Perhaps most important is that Plan Nacer profoundly changed the roles
of key actors and shifted focus to results, strengthening the long-term capacity of the health system.

In Brazil, the federal government has incorporated performance-based transfers to municipalities since
1998 to stimulate expansion of a Family Health Program that provides maternal health and FP services.
As population coverage by Family Health Teams increases, municipalities receive higher transfers per
team per year, providing incentives to expand the program and serve the poorest Brazilians.

Between 1994 and 2008, the proportion of the population covered by Family Health Teams expanded
from zero to 31 percent.

Beginning in 2009, Brazil is piloting an enhanced incentive scheme that links funding to performance on
eight indicators that cover effectiveness (health outputs), efficiency (reduced hospital admissions), and
management. FP is not explicitly incentivized; however, it continues to be included in the package of
services provided by Family Health Teams.

Many insights throughout come from discussion with Cristian Baeza, then lead health specialist of the World Bank, who
designed this Adaptable Program Loan (APL).

15

In Zambia, a pilot has been designed and will soon be implemented that establishes performance
incentives for regional health teams and district health teams that are aligned with performance
incentives for health facilities. Facilities will have the opportunity to earn fees for each new FP acceptor.
In addition, a quality assessment tool is being developed to incentivize quality counseling as part of the
full package of services. This approach is designed to motivate health actors at each level of the system
to resolve bottlenecks, work hard, and strengthen the performance of the health system, with a focus
on maternal and newborn health, including FP.

This pilot, supported by Norway and the U.K. Department for International Development (DFID)
through a World Bank-managed “Health Results Innovation Trust Fund," will examine the impact of PBI
in nine districts of Zambia as compared with two groups of controls (nine districts receive the same
funding as the PBI districts but with no performance conditions and nine other districts continue with
“business as usual"). Regional health teams and district health teams will also be rewarded with
incentives to provide the supervision and technical support to help facilities achieve performance goals.
Facilities will earn fees for a list of services in addition to the fixed budget and health worker salaries.
Performance fees earned by facilities will be partly used to invest in the facility and in community
outreach activities and will be partly shared by facility workers.

4.3. CONTRACTING NGOS AND PAYING PARTLY BASED ON
DOCUMENTED RESULTS IN FRAGILE, LOW-RESOURCE
SETTINGS

In low-resource settings with limited health infrastructure, increasing access to FP commodities may be
one of the most effective strategies to reduce both maternal and child mortality. Many FP commodities
can be distributed by community health workers and through other product distribution channels that
already exist at village level, making scale-up easier and faster than, for example, investing in
infrastructure to manage emergency deliveries and in training highly skilled health workers. In
Afghanistan (with World Bank support), DR Congo (World Bank), Haiti (USAID), Liberia (USAID),
and Southern Sudan (USAID and World Bank), NGOs are contracted to directly deliver services
and/or oversee service delivery in a geographic area. This sometimes includes paying incentives and
providing support to public health teams and public facilities as well as second-tier contracts to service
delivery NGOs. These settings have in common a relatively weak public service delivery system and a
history of relatively strong NGOs delivering services in the context of fragility from conflict or lack of
government leadership. Contracting NGOs and paying based on results has proven to be an effective
strategy to ensure that services reach the population in fragile contexts. In some settings (Afghanistan
and Liberia), NGO contracting has also been effectively used to bolster the steering role of the national
Ministry of Health. What follows is a brief description of each of these models with emphasis on the
role of voluntary FP.

In 2002, donors and the nascent Afghanistan Ministry of Public Health decided to contract NGOs to
provide access to a package of essential health services that includes increasing access to FP. Distinct
contractual approaches were adopted by three donors (European Union, World Bank, and USAID),
enabling comparison across approaches (Sondorp et al., 2009). The World Bank incorporated a true PBI
approach that provided the opportunity for NGOs that received contracts to deliver services in an
entire province to earn a performance bonus based on how they performed on a “balanced scorecard"

(BSC). The BSC considers 28 indicators along six domains. In the “capacity for service delivery" domain
is one indicator termed the “FP availability index." NGOs are paid based on a fixed and reliable budget
with a small portion linked to results. Original architects of this model now question whether putting
more funding at risk might generate larger results.7 Confounders such as variations in security make it
difficult to unambiguously conclude the PBI approach was more effective than the approaches adopted
by the European Union and USAID. However, the major donors are converging on a unified approach
that incorporates rewards for results.

The FP availability index measures the availability of FP supplies in health facilities. The index assigns one
point for each of the following items if they were in stock “throughout the last month": condoms; oral
contraceptive pills; Depot Medroxy Progrestrone Acetate (DMPA), an injectable contraceptive; and
intrauterine devices (IUDs). The range of scores possible for each facility is 0-4. Figure 2 shows a steady
increase in availability of modern methods from 2004 to 2008 as measured by the FP availability index.

FIGURE 2: AFGHANISTAN FP AVAILABILITY INDEX FROM BSC RESULTS (200408)

The DR Congo has a relatively long history of contracting out management of health in geographic
regions. Currently (in 2010) the European Union, the World Bank, and Cordaid are supporting PBI
programs in different parts of the country through various NGOs that include FP.

17

Since 2007, the European Union is funding a PBI program in North Kivu, Kasai Orientale, Kasai
Occidentale, and Orientale provinces of DR Congo. The program contracts seven NGOs to oversee
delivery of health services that includes FP. PBI in DR Congo, known as l'approche contractuelle, was
designed to address maternal health including FP, child health, infectious diseases, and chronic
conditions. Incentives target three levels in the health system: zonal health teams and provincial health
teams, health centers, and reference hospitals. Zonal and provincial health teams can earn bonuses
linked to attainment of targets. Health centers and hospitals receive fees for each service provided on a
list. Fees are included for the following FP services: tubal ligation and vasectomies, new and continuing
FP users, and IUDs and implants. Funds for these services are transferred to the facility level and are
used for facility costs, transportation, and bonus payments for health workers (Kwete and Hsi 2010).
This approach suffers from payment delays, problems with verification of data, and tensions between
health teams and facility staff. One design challenge is the conflict of interest that exists when health
teams are responsible for verifying the health facility results that they also are paid for achieving. The
project has funding through 2010.

In 1999, USAID shifted its approach, in a long-running project managed by Management Sciences for
Health (MSH), to contracting NGOs in Haiti from paying for documented spending on inputs to paying
for achievement of output and performance results. In the initial phase, FP indicators were rewarded.
However, in subsequent years, FP was dropped from the list of rewarded indicators because of a
misunderstanding that PBI of any type linked to indicators of FP would violate the Tiahrt Amendment
and a concern that FP indicators might be misinterpreted and inappropriately implemented in the local
context. The PBI approach in Haiti, and how it evolved, contains lessons for PBI programs as well as
insight into what may happen if FP is left off the list of rewarded services (Eichler et al. 2009).

PBI in Haiti began with a pilot with three NGOs that provided services to roughly 500,000 people.
Additional NGOs were progressively graduated into a PBI payment regime until 2005, when all health
service delivery NGOs supported by USAID were paid based on results. This approach continued and
PBI with the public sector was planned until the devastation brought by the earthquake in January 2010.

Payment consists of a portion that is regular and reliable and paid in four lump sum quarterly payments,
and an annual award fee that is based on whether targets that were established at contract signing are
achieved. Through 2005, roughly 95 percent of an NGO's historical budget was regular and reliable with
the opportunity to earn the 5 percent withheld amount plus an additional 5 percent bonus linked to
attainment of performance targets. After 2005, the withheld amount increased to 6 percent (94 percent
regular and reliable) and up to an additional 6 percent could be earned if all targets were reached.
Targets are established relative to each NGO's baseline level from the previous contract period. Each
target has a performance payment associated with it and payment for attainment of each target is “all or
nothing."

Two FP indicators were included in the pilot phase in Haiti: (i) all service delivery points have availability
of at least five modern FP methods (measured by facility stock audit), and (ii) reduced FP discontinuation
rate (measured by FP register review). The first indicator was reached by all the NGOs and, for this
reason, was not included in future years. The second indicator was designed to motivate better client
communication and more effective counseling with the goal of reducing FP discontinuation. It provided
incentives to deliver quality services to women who had already chosen to use a modern method and

aimed to reduce the drop-out rate slightly (and by no means eliminate discontinuation when women
wanted to get pregnant). As explained above, FP was dropped from the list of rewarded indicators after
the pilot year because of a misunderstanding that PBI of any type linked to indicators of FP would violate
the Tiahrt Amendment and a concern that incentivizing FP might be inappropriately implemented in the
local context. Ongoing tracking of a more comprehensive list of indicators than the ones connected with
performance awards enabled examination of performance trends for FP. Because FP was eliminated
from the list of rewarded services, this analysis show increases for rewarded health indicators while FP
performance remained stagnant. This suggests that providers focused efforts on improving performance
of rewarded services and possibly neglected FP. The experience in Haiti suggests that failure to include
voluntary FP was a missed opportunity and that identifying indicators of FP that can be responsibly
incorporated into PBI programs is a priority  especially in environments where incentives are also
linked to other services.

Liberia and Southern Sudan are the newest examples of governments that are contracting NGOs to
deliver health services that include incentives linked to FP. Both are using an approach with some
similarities to what is used in Haiti. Liberia awarded contracts to NGOs to oversee delivery of services
at the county level. A full package of services that includes FP is funded with a subset linked to a
performance payment. USAID contracts in Liberia provide full funding for the activities in each contract
(as compared with including a “withheld" amount as is done in Haiti) and use the performance payment
as an added sweetener. A potential performance payment is linked to the FP indicator, “number of sites
with staff member competent to provide counseling on informed choice for family planning."8 As the
contracts had not completed the first full year at the time of writing this report, no results are available
on the effectiveness of this indicator and approach.

In 2009, USAID awarded a project to MSH to support performance-based provision of health services in
Southern Sudan by paying NGOs to deliver services that include FP to a geographic region of
Southern Sudan. The approach is to establish performance targets for a package of primary health
services and to reward NGOs each quarter for attainment of performance targets. NGOs will have a
fixed price contract that is based on reasonable costs of providing the full package of services in the
regions they serve. This fixed price portion will be provided in regular and reliable quarterly payments
conditional on certain deliverables such as reporting. In addition, NGOs will have the opportunity to
earn up to an additional 6 percent of the value of the annual fixed price budget if they attain or surpass
their performance targets. Performance payments are at the level of an NGO that has multiple service
delivery points.

19

In addition to a range of child health, maternal health, malaria, nutrition, hygiene and sanitation,
HIV/AIDS prevention, and health systems strengthening indicators, the following five FP/birth spacing
indicators are included:

Assessment of U.S. government (USG)-assisted clinic facilities' compliance with clinical standards (in
Southern Sudan, must have at least four methods available)

NGOs have responsibility for delivering services in a geographic region of Southern Sudan and indicators
and targets are set for a large geographic area. NGOs will report achievement on the full list of
indicators each quarter. However, to manage the logistical and financing costs of ongoing validation, a
subset of indicators will be randomly selected each quarter for verification. Readers should note that these
indicators would be inappropriate if used to incentivize individual health workers.

A number of challenges, which are likely relevant for other post-conflict and fragile states, have delayed
final agreement on the terms of contracts with NGOs.9 The first is that it is difficult to derive robust
estimates of the cost of delivering services in challenging environments with limited infrastructure (e.g.,
few roads), few trained health workers, weak management capacity, rudimentary information systems,
etc. Information to reliably determine budgets is more important when paying lump-sum fixed-price
contracts than in environments where reimbursement is for documented spending. A second challenge
is that some NGOs are reluctant to commit to achieving performance targets when they do not control
the supply of inputs that are essential for achieving targets, such as bednets and vitamin A. A third
challenge is that seasonal variation makes access and delivery of health services almost impossible during
some parts of the year, causing NGOs to be reluctant to commit to quarterly targets that are not
feasible to achieve during the period. A fourth challenge is that reliable population figures
(denominators) required for obtaining intervention coverage estimates do not exist and baseline
performance data are unreliable.

Driven by the desire to improve health results that includes FP, often with a focus on the health MDGs,
a number of national governments are scaling up PBI approaches in their public systems. In some
settings, private providers, including NGOs and faith-based organizations, are also incorporated. Before
PBI is introduced, public health facility staff in most public settings receive a fixed salary that does not
vary by whether they do a good or poor job and, in many cases, is not impacted if they work less than
their full shift or are frequently absent. This dysfunctional incentive environment predictably does not
generate intensive efforts to provide quality FP and other health services. To address this poor
performance, some governments are implementing performance incentives. In many cases, countries
begin with pilots and revise and refine as they evaluate and learn before scaling up.

In Rwanda and Burundi national governments (or donors following a standardized national approach)
pay additional fees to health facilities (per service delivered) linked to delivery of a list of priority
services that include new and continuing FP users and, in Burundi, specified methods. In Rwanda, the
fees are discounted by quality assessment scores and in Burundi facilities have the opportunity to earn
an additional bonus for performance on quality assessments. In all settings, facility-level payments are
partly used to reward health workers. In Egypt, as part of the strategy to roll out a new family health
model, health facilities providing this integrated care model have the opportunity to earn performance
bonuses linked to attainment of health targets (including FP) and these performance payments are
distributed partly to individual staff. Honduras has implemented a PBI strategy aimed at improving
quality in public hospitals that incorporates FP indicators.

Perhaps most well known because of the recent impact evaluation that has been widely disseminated,
Rwanda has scaled up a unified national PBI model that pays health facilities (public and private) fees for
a list of services and then assesses quality and applies the quality score to discount fees (Basinga and
Vermeesch 2009, Basinga et al. 2009). Increasing access to FP is a government priority reflected in how
district political leaders are accountable to the national level as well as inclusion of FP in the package of
services rewarded with performance-based financing fees in health facilities. Included in the list of
rewarded services at the health center level are fees for new FP acceptors and additional fees for
resupply of FP. In addition, a measure of quality of FP is assessed that assigns weights to both a
structural component of FP (such as commodity availability) and a process component assessed through
medical record review.

PBI in Rwanda began in 2002 with two donor-funded and NGO-implemented pilots with different design
and implementation arrangements. After both models showed better results than in comparable districts
without PBI, and after promising results from a third pilot that began in 2005, the Ministry of Health
decided to scale up a common national model that incorporated features of each of the pilots. This is an
interesting example of a case of where pilots informed and led to national scale-up (Rusa et al. 2009).

Inspired by strong results in neighboring Rwanda, in 2006 Burundi began with pilots of its own supply-
side PBI model that includes FP, which it now intends to expand to scale (Busogoro and Beith 2010).
With this scheme, Burundi hopes to reduce adolescent pregnancy and increase the contraceptive
prevalence rate, as well as improve maternal and child health. Payments are based partly on quality of
care delivered, measured by patient and community satisfaction, and partly on use of quantity-related
incentive payments determined by multiplying fees for specified services by the quantities provided. As in
Rwanda, public health centers receive monthly fees for a list of services that include FP indicators, which
in Burundi are fees for new FP acceptors and for insertion of IUDs and implants. In addition to fees paid
monthly, quality is assessed quarterly and facilities have the opportunity to earn a bonus of up to an
additional 15 percent of the revenues earned during the quarter determined by how the facility scores
on a quality assessment. Monthly fees and quarterly quality bonuses are earned at the facility level; a
portion is used for facility upgrades and the rest is shared among facility staff. In Gitega Province, for
example, FP utilization levels rose from an annual average of around 300 women consultations per
month to just over 800 per month in two years (see Figure 3).

21

FIGURE 3: INCREASES IN FP UTILIZATION FOLLOWING INTRODUCTION OF A PBI PILOT
IN GITEGA PROVINCE, BURUNDI

During the pilots, health facility quality was assessed quarterly using 154 service-specific composite
indicators. Contracts were established between Provincial Purchasing Agencies and local associations
that are responsible for validating health services received at the community level, to determine
satisfaction with services used, and to assess the extent of patient/community knowledge. Patients are
asked how they were treated by providers, what medicines were prescribed (if any), and what follow-up
took place. Findings from these quarterly community surveys are fed back to the respective health care
providers. Part of the quality payment that facilities receive depends on the results of these surveys
conducted by the local associations. Each facility can earn a bonus of up to 15 percent of the total
amount obtained on quantitative results during the same time period. The Ministry of Health intends to
raise this bonus to 25 percent during nationwide scale-up.

In 2001, Egypt introduced PBI into their family physicians approach to primary health care in the public
health delivery system in five governorates. Through PBI, facilities receive a financial incentive when they
attain health targets. Two FP targets are established using the following indicators: (i) the percentage of
females of reproductive age (ages 1545) using FP by method, and (ii) the percentage of females of
reproductive age using FP relative to the total number in the catchment area. These indicators are
reported monthly to the health district and validated by examining the primary health care logbook
maintained at each facility. This financial incentive is then distributed to the health care staff within the
facility according to a point system that is based on variables such as qualifications, experience, number
of days worked, and efforts made to achieve the indicators in each area. Financial value of each point is
determined by dividing total payment by total points and each staff member receives this value multiplied
by the points they earned. This approach has succeeded in increasing utilization of key services including
FP (El Hayatmy et al. 2010).

The opportunity to earn significant performance bonuses (roughly a 250 percent increase in salary) has
drawn medical specialists into family medicine. However, a significant challenge confronting Egypt is that
it is not clear how to continue to finance this scheme. One of the architects of the scheme now believes
that donor funding should be used to help design and implement PBI schemes, but should not be used to
pay financial incentives. If this advice had been followed in Egypt, it is likely that the magnitude of the
incentive payments would have been lower and financial sustainability more feasible.10

With support from USAID, the Health Care Improvement (HCI) Project, and MSH, the Government of
Honduras has introduced PBI that consists of monetary payments to hospitals based on their execution
of quality improvement plans. These plans emphasize appropriate and effective implementation of a
package of maternal and newborn services that includes FP, in that payment depends partially on the
percentage of post-obstetric event patients who received information about and were offered FP
methods. The level of funding that a hospital can receive depends on the degree to which each indicator
is met. Targets are set by the central Ministry of Health and each hospital. A small portion of the
hospital incentive payment goes directly to members of the quality improvement teams. PBI introduction
has resulted in significant improvements in quality of care indicators. Additionally, other programs
outside of maternal/newborn health have become motivated to adopt quality improvement methods.

4.5. VOUCHER SCHEMES ENABLE ACCESS TO A PACKAGE OF
SUBSIDIZED SERVICES, REDUCING CLIENT FINANCIAL
BARRIERS AND INCREASING PROVIDER MOTIVATION TO
SERVE THE POOR

A number of countries are implementing voucher models that either provide at no charge, or sell for a
small fee, books of coupons that enable access to services that include FP. In some settings, voucher
holders have a choice of provider that can include public and private options, while in other settings
voucher holders are assigned to specific providers. Some voucher schemes are run by the government,
while others are purely private. Voucher approaches are most often used to target poor and
marginalized populations. We know of voucher schemes in Pakistan and Kenya that include coupons
to access FP services. Several other countries (Bangladesh, Cambodia, Myanmar, Nepal, Nicaragua,
Uganda) are using some form of vouchers but they either do not include FP or we were not able to
verify the specific contents of the subsidized package. Voucher approaches incorporate incentives on
both the demand and supply side.

23

In Pakistan, Population Services International (PSI) has enhanced the capabilities of the Greenstar social
franchise and formed another franchise called “GoodLife" to pilot a voucher program in the Dera Ghazi
Khan district that provides access to a full package of maternal health services from network private
providers. The package comprises prenatal care, delivery, postnatal care, and FP. Poor pregnant women
who have previously given birth at home are visited by Lady Health Workers, a form of community
health worker, and educated about the benefits of delivering in a health facility. In addition to financial
barriers, there are significant social and cultural barriers to overcome  men and mothers-in-law are
decision makers and community tradition is to deliver at home. It may take multiple visits for the
woman and her family to elect to purchase a voucher book for a small fee that enables access to a
package of services from a GoodLife Provider. When the woman presents for services, the provider
gives her funds to cover the cost of transportation. After services are provided, providers submit the
vouchers to a voucher management agency managed by PSI and receive payment for the services
provided; the payment includes fees for each FP counseling session and for provision of modern
methods. This process enables PSI to track actual utilization of services by each voucher recipient by
verifying voucher serial numbers against client names (Bashir et al. 2010).

In this pilot, 78 percent (1,569) of voucher recipients returned to a contracted provider after delivering
to receive FP counseling. Of these, 32 percent chose not to adopt a FP method, while the others chose
methods as shown in Figure 4.

It is important to note that women paying a fee for the voucher book indicates that they were
convinced of the value of the services and suggests that accessing FP counseling and use of a modern
method was chosen voluntarily. Interestingly, in Pakistan there is also evidence of a positive spillover
effect as many voucher recipients brought 34 pregnant women from their family or neighborhood for
care at the health facility. This suggests that the voucher scheme may have resulted in changed behavior
of other community members, most striking given that these women had to pay fully for services out of
pocket.

A maternal health voucher scheme that includes FP has also been implemented in Kenya, where uptake
of delivery services exceeded expectations but FP utilization fell far short. Voucher distributors are
contracted by a voucher management agency, funded by KFW, to sell subsidized FP vouchers within
(currently five) pilot sites. Voucher distributors receive a monthly salary and are trained in how to apply
a standardized poverty assessment tool, adapted by Marie Stopes International for the Kenya context, to
grade potential clients on criteria including housing, access to health sources, water sources and
sanitation, daily income, and number of meals per day. Voucher distributors must also conduct home
visits to verify the poverty grading tool responses. Sometimes informal arrangements are made between
the distributors and the clients if clients cannot pay the full voucher fee upfront. For example, they can
arrange to pay the distributor in installments. Voucher holders provide the purchased vouchers to their
preferred accredited service provider to receive the services linked to the particular type of voucher.

One lesson from the Kenya experience is that vouchers reduce financial barriers to accessing FP
services, but they do not alone address other determinants of the choice to use FP. Other reasons
inhibiting use of FP in Kenya are concerns about safety, religious prohibition, personal opposition, and a
desired family size of many children. Identifying outlets for FP commodities and access are not major
issues for any age group. This highlights the need to take into account local attitudes towards FP and to
consider developing appropriate marketing and educational outreach components when designing a
voluntary FP PBI intervention (Bellows et al. 2009). The next phase of this pilot intends to address these
complementary components.

PBI can also be used to motivate community health workers. These workers play an important role in
identifying pregnant women, in counseling women, families, and their communities, and in recognizing
where FP demand is unmet. Examples of this include both India and the Philippines, where community
health workers receive financial incentives dependent on completion of a package of services. In both
cases, payment to the workers is accompanied by demand-side payments to overcome financial and
social obstacles poor women face.

In India, the government-supported Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) program provides PBI to individual
female village-level community health workers, called Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHA), who
serve as a liaison between the community and government health systems. ASHAs are responsible for
implementation of a full package of care composed of a number of activities that assist a woman through
pregnancy and delivery and that are important to both the woman and the newborn's health directly

25

following birth. Payment to ASHAs from the JSY is conditional on their completing all of these activities,
which includes FP counseling. The JSY program also provides demand-side payments to women, which
are linked to facility-based delivery, not specifically to FP.11 Eligibility criteria differ by state.12 In what are
called “low-performing states" all pregnant women of any caste, age, or income group who deliver in a
government or accredited private health facility qualify for the JSY program and receive the financial
incentive. In “high performing states" all pregnant women who are members of scheduled caste/schedule
tribe communities and pregnant women who are below the poverty line and older than 19 years qualify
for the program.

In addition, the National Rural Health Mission in India provides payments to individuals who choose
sterilization, to the community health worker who accompanies them, and to the service provider who
performs the sterilization services (Government of India 2007). In low-performing states, below poverty
line women who receive tubectomies receive 600 rupees, below poverty line men receive 1100 rupees
for vasectomies, and ASHAs receive 150-200 rupees when they accompany women for tubectomies and
men for vasectomies. These fees are intended to cover the opportunity costs of lost wages and travel. In
addition to fees paid to ASHAs and individuals, there are fees for the service providers who provide
sterilization services.

The Philippines is currently piloting a performance-based payment scheme with the goal of supporting
facility-based childbirth and increasing the role of skilled attendance at delivery among disadvantaged
women. FP is included as part of the package of maternal health services, but it is not explicitly
rewarded. As in India, the scheme includes both supply- and demand-side payments. On the supply side,
payment goes to Women's Health Teams (WHTs), which are composed of a rural health unit midwife,
one barangay health worker,13 and one traditional birth attendant. On the demand side, women
delivering in an appropriate health facility also receive a payment to offset childbirth-related expenses,
such as transportation to reach the facility, and medicines, medical supplies, and food required during
the stay. Funded through the Department of Health and Municipal Local Government Units, this scheme
is designed to encourage WHTs to track and counsel all women within their catchment area and to
encourage pregnant women to have facility-based deliveries. Like the India JSY program's ASHAs, WHTs
are responsible for implementing a full package of care. However, while FP is part of this package
(WHTs organize outreach activities for FP and provide counseling), FP itself is not explicitly incentivized,
as both supply- and demand-side payments are tied only to facility-based delivery.

CCT programs are large-scale social protection programs that link income transfers to poor households
if specified conditions are met, usually related to utilization of health, education, and nutrition services.
Since 1997, seven countries in Latin America and the Caribbean (Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador,

11 Acceptors of sterilization and IUD insertion in public and private accredited health facilities receive payments from the
National Rural Health Mission meant to compensate for lost wages. ASHAs who refer people receive fees and the
facilities receive payments.
12 The government of India has divided states into two categories based on rates of institutional delivery. The 10 states
with the lowest rates of institutional delivery are classified as “low-performing states"; they are Assam, Bihar, Chattisgarh,
Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Uttaranchal, and Jammu and Kashmir. The remaining 18
states are “high-performing states"; they are Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal
Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Punjab, Sikkim, Tamil Nadu, Tripura,
and West Bengal.
13 Barangay health workers are individuals who have undergone training programs under any accredited governmental or
nongovernmental organization program and who provide primarily health care services in their community after having
been accredited to function as such by the local health board in accordance with the guidelines promulgated by the
Philippines Department of Health.

Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, Nicaragua) have implemented and evaluated CCT programs with
health and nutrition components (Glassman et al. 2009). Health and nutrition components of CCTs aim
to stimulate demand for health services by transferring cash to mothers conditional on their seeking
services for themselves and their children at health clinics and attending health education talks that
cover FP, among other topics. CCTs may influence use of FP by improving understanding of FP benefits
through health education talks, increasing access to FP commodities by incentivizing more frequent
contact with the formal service delivery system, and by intensifying the focus on investing in their
children's health and education.

CCTs may also have the perverse effect of stimulating an increase in fertility if cash transfers are linked
to family size or numbers of children in school. Unintended effects of the CCT program in Honduras
may have contributed to a 24 percent increase in fertility  a possible result of providing income
transfers that vary with the number of children and pregnant women in a household (Stecklov et al.
2006). This effect was not observed in Mexico and Nicaragua, where income transfers do not vary
with family size. CCTs in Mexico appear to have delayed the onset of premarital sex, age of marriage,
and age at first and second birth (Gulemetova-Swan 2009).

As health programs throughout the developing world incorporate demand- and supply-side PBI, there is
a real danger that voluntary FP will be neglected if not included. Progress in voluntary FP might stall or
decline if FP is left out and with it the missed opportunity to contribute to broader development goals.
By building on ways voluntary FP has been included in developing-country PBI approaches, identifying
challenges and gaps, and contributing to a future agenda to fill these gaps, FP can be incorporated in
ways that are effective as well as responsible and can protect voluntary choice and be in compliance with
USAID FP requirements. The cases described in this paper can inform those operating in the USG-
funded context as well as others who value voluntarism about relevant PBI options. There is some
evidence that some countries are choosing not to include FP at least partially due to concerns about the
Tiahrt Amendment; as one PBI survey respondent shared, “the indicators for this scheme have not been
designed yet. However, the indicators will not target a number of family planning acceptors due to Tiahrt
amendment concerns." We wish to reassure program designers and implementers that voluntary FP can
be included in PBI programs in ways that comply with U.S. FP requirements.

There is a need, however, to develop indicators of quality, in addition to the quantity measures that are
in current use. The majority of FP indicators currently included in developing-country PBI programs
focus on quantities of commodities or services delivered rather than quality of counseling or clinical
care. They reward availability of needed inputs (e.g., availability of commodities, availability of trained
staff) or numbers of FP services delivered (e.g., new acceptors). Few programs reward provision of
quality counseling or FP services, partly because quality is harder to specify, measure, and verify than is
quantity. This challenge is not unique to FP, as early PBI programs usually begin by rewarding the “low
hanging fruit" of relatively simple to measure, countable services that can be reported through existing
information systems.

As donors embrace the principles of country-led health plans and this is complemented by increased
accountability for results, linking payment to performance is likely to increase in prominence. We may
see more PBA, as donors condition payment to countries on achieved results. We may also see an
increase in national to sub-national PBI as governments exercise their influence through conditions
attached to intergovernmental fiscal transfers. At the national and sub-national levels, rewarding
population coverage of voluntary FP services as well as their quality is consistent with U.S. FP
requirements.

Because true impact occurs at the interface between users and service providers, any incentive
approach has to strengthen the systems needed to reach clients and ensure delivery of voluntary, quality
FP counseling and services. Rewarding population-based targets is consistent with U.S. FP requirements
if the level being rewarded is a facility or team, as long as facilities have more than one person on staff.
Payment for each service is acceptable at the facility/team or individual provider level, as long as
payments are reasonable and in line with payments for other services. FP users can receive payments to
offset transportation costs to overcome this often significant barrier to access. Rewards for quality
counseling and service delivery, if feasible metrics are developed, can be used at each level.

In settings with service delivery NGOs and private providers, contracts can incorporate conditions that
require achievement of specified results, and payment can be linked to this achievement. This is true in
weak state settings as well as stable contexts. Governments, donors, and social insurance entities can
incorporate PBI for voluntary FP counseling and services into the payment terms with NGOs, FBOs, and

29

private providers. Payment can reward attainment of population coverage or pay for each FP service
delivered, provided that the per service payment is in line with payments for other services. Rewarding
quality FP counseling and service provision is a priority with private providers as discussed above. In
some settings, voucher schemes may help create a “market" for providing FP counseling and services,
increasing both supply of quality services and demand. By reducing prices paid by the poor and
complementing these subsidized prices with top ups that pay providers competitive fees, financial access
barriers for poor households can be partially overcome and willingness to serve the poor can increase.
When users pay even small fees to purchase vouchers, it is an indication of voluntary choice. Rewarding
availability of modern methods may be a strong indicator during the early stages of a PBI scheme,
especially in low-resource environments. However, this indicator appears to respond quickly and may
need to be replaced with measures of counseling, use, or quality as systems develop and commodities
become more reliably available. Once information systems are in place to report on counseling and
acceptance of methods, countries are able to incorporate measures of quantity into performance
incentive programs. The coming challenge is to develop measures of quality counseling and quality
service provision that can be measured and validated in a routine and cost-effective way to be able to
link to performance payments.

To support development of PBI approaches that incorporate voluntary FP, countries may request
technical assistance to help structure the terms of payment agreements; to define rewarded
performance measures; to establish the administrative functions needed to contract, monitor, verify, and
pay; and to train recipients of PBI arrangements to understand new rules and how to effectively respond
to them to achieve results. Countries may also appreciate help with strategies to consult with
stakeholders during the design phase to assess what will work and refine the approach. Input to develop
advocacy strategies to identify challenges and build support for a feasible PBI approach may also be
appreciated.

Paying for FP results has potential to contribute to reducing unwanted and mistimed pregnancies and, by
doing so, contribute to reducing maternal and newborn mortality. For countries already implementing
PBI, including voluntary FP in the package of rewarded services will help to motivate providers to
counsel couples about the benefits of FP and the choices available and will help to ensure that voluntary
FP is not neglected. This paper describes a number of approaches that can be considered that
incorporate FP into PBI schemes responsibly and in accordance with U.S. FP requirements. As PBI is
evolving and learning and innovation is a dynamic process, we can expect to continue to learn about
effective approaches to incorporate voluntary FP.

ANNEX: EXPANDING ACCESS TO FP
AND PROTECTING INFORMED
CHOICE IN THE UNITED STATES

We have chosen to highlight the U.S. experience with FP to share one example of how the tension
between using payments to reward providers for the provision of services that are adopted voluntarily
and safeguarding the voluntarism of clients' adoption of the service can be minimized. In addition to
presenting an opportunity for reproductive control, prevention of health and social consequences of
mistimed or unwanted pregnancies, and prevention of the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, a FP
visit can also serve as a woman's entry into the health system (Institute of Medicine [IOM] 2009). These
opportunities are joined with unique challenges in delivering FP as a health service.

Despite being one of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) top-10 great public
health achievements during the 20th century (see Figure A-1), FP was not always available to those
seeking to have smaller families or longer birth intervals (CDC April 1999). To meet the rising demand
for contraception, the U.S. Congress passed several laws designed to expand access to FP. Title X
(“Title Ten") of the Public Health Service Act of 1970 authorized the Department of Health and Human
Service's Office of Family Planning to give grants to public and nonprofit entities to establish and operate
FP clinics, train service providers, conduct research, and engage in community outreach (IOM 2009) The
program is hereafter referred to as the Title X program. The state/federal Medicaid program was
amended in 1972 to require states to cover FP services. To incentivize states to expand these services
further, the federal government has paid for a larger proportion of FP services than it does other health
services on average since 1966.14 Overall, the late 20th century was characterized by initiatives to allow
patients and their physicians to access FP, as well as generate more demand for FP through education
and outreach.

Contemporary views on FP are that individuals have the right to practice FP if desired, but the practice
must be voluntary and providers must ensure informed consent. In the past, there have been cases in
the United States where today's standards for voluntarism in FP programs have not been upheld. In
some cases, FP was forced on non-consenting women by powerful institutions (Schoen 2005). As a
response to allegations of forced sterilizations, state legislatures have created laws and regulatory
agencies to ensure that voluntarism is unequivocally protected.

14 The Federal Medical Assistance Percentages (FMAPs) are percentages of the total cost of a Medicaid health service that
the federal government pays. The remainder is paid by the state in which the recipient resides. Generally, FMAPs are at
least 50 percent and vary by state depending on the state's per capita income relative to the national average. FP enjoys a
special status among covered services. The federal government pays 90 percent of services and supplies for Medicaid
beneficiaries in all states, as per Section 1903 [42 U.S.C. 1396b] of the Social Security Act, amended in 1965.

PBI, called Pay for Performance (P4P) in the U.S. context, started in the United States in the 1980s, in
private health care. More recently, P4P programs have expanded into public provision of health care.15
Performance measures have been designed, critiqued, and amended through the participation of a rich
array of experts and stakeholders. The U.S. health system is different from those of low- and middle-
income countries, with its mix of private and public payers (such as Medicare and Medicaid), private and
public providers, and a dizzying mix of payment mechanisms, incentives, and initiatives to control costs
and improve quality. This diversity contains important lessons for other contexts; however, this
incentive “soup" is murkier in the United States than in most developing-country contexts, making the
potential impact of a P4P scheme in a developing country potentially even more powerful.

We found no evidence of direct use of P4P to improve FP procurement and delivery in the United
States. This may reflect an absence of need to incentivize providers to offer FP services. The P4P
movement entered health care practice long after the advent of successful nationwide federally funded
FP programs. Most counties in the United States now have at least one provider offering comprehensive
FP services regardless of the patient's ability to pay (Frost et al. 2004). This widespread availability may
have been a factor in allowing Congress to exempt FP from Medicaid managed care programs as
Medicaid moved away from fee-for-service in the 1990s (Lindberg et al. 2006).

Characteristics of American society fostered growth in demand for contraception and other FP services
in the 20th century and eventually contributed to changes in the way health care was delivered in the
United States. Civil society groups and women's rights advocates helped to spread awareness of FP and

Some large P4P programs currently operating in the private sector include The Leapfrog Group's Hospital Rewards
Program (www.leapfroggroup.org), Bridges to Excellence programs and PROMETHEUS payment schemes
(http://bridgestoexcellence.org), and Integrated Healthcare Association's PBI program in California
(http://www.iha.org/pay_performance.html). The USG has also started PBI programs in the public health sector through
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid's Premier Hospital Quality Incentive Demonstration and Physician Group
Practice Demonstration (www.cms.hhs.gov).

empower women to demand reproductive rights. Patient demand for FP was high and the health system
had to expand to meet that demand. Additionally, providers became early advocates of FP for their
patients. Fee-for-service provider reimbursement encouraged delivery of high quantities of health
services, thus provider motivation was not a large issue in the United States, unlike in poorer countries
with salaried physicians. Availability of funding, good infrastructure, and relatively low entry barriers to
the private health care sector allowed the health care system to expand and for Medicaid and the Title
X program to be implemented nationwide.

While developing country contexts differ, popular and political recognition of the importance of FP
warranted the creation of these U.S.-based domestic programs for many of the same reasons FP merits
consideration in P4P programs abroad. Aside from provider motivation and patient demand, there are
issues that seem to transcend national income levels and populations. Medicaid and the Title X program
were created to expand access to FP to vulnerable populations such as low-income people. These
programs were intended to address health care equity, protect voluntarism and informed choice, and
balance competing forces.

FP indicators that have been used in domestic programs have been designed with those goals in mind,
and may be helpful in guiding designs for FP indicators in P4P programs in those settings. Box A-1
contains a list of indicators currently used to evaluate the Title X program and new ones proposed by
the IOM that further emphasize quality of services and patient-centered care (see IOM 2009).

Some aspects of the Title X program in the United States have elicited discussion that may be relevant
in P4P programs that include FP indicators. The first discussion centers around balancing informed
choice with effectiveness and efficiency. To protect informed choice, providers who receive funding
from the program must discuss the entire range of FP options with new patients. While it is thought
that many providers and commentators believe an emphasis on education and counseling is important
for protecting informed choice and contributes to more satisfied patients (Gold 2008), the IOM offers
that excessive information could interfere with the patient's retention of knowledge and is
counterproductive when patients come in for a visit with a method preference (IOM 2009). These two
demands can compete and must be balanced when designing P4P indicators that protect informed
choice.

The second discussion surrounds balancing opportunities to provide comprehensive care with the goal
of attracting as many patients as possible. Health-seeking behavior may be reinforced if patients feel that
they can seek any service unconditionally. If women visit a health center to obtain contraception, it is
tempting to take advantage of the woman's presence by providing her other health services. The
woman's visit for FP may be her only visit to a health center. However, women may be intimidated by
other tests, shots, or services and may choose not to visit the health center for FP purposes if she
knows that obtaining other services are preconditions. Potential patients of Title X clinics reportedly
avoided a visit when the Title X program required that all new patients receive a Pap smear at their first
visit. To ensure that the clinics could attract as many women as possible, the program modified this
provision by allowing the woman six months after her first visit to receive a Pap smear (IOM 2009).
While public health experts wanted as many women as possible to be screened for cervical cancer,
provision of contraception may have been compromised as an unintended consequence.

A final issue that has been discussed in the U.S. domestic context is voluntarism. For example, the
Medicaid program tried to balance convenience and maximum services provided with attention to
voluntarism. However, it is often possible for physicians to perform sterilization at the time of a
woman's delivery and while many women ask for this service voluntarily, there is potential for abuse
given that the physician is in a position of power. After 1978, the Medicaid program no longer
reimbursed physicians for sterilizations performed at the time of delivery; instead, women must have
given informed consent 30 days prior to the service in most cases (Kaiser Family Foundation 2005).
Some critics argue that this law is harmful to public health because some women never return for the
service, but others argue it is necessary to protect voluntarism.

fullbody^viiThe authors would like to thank Beverly Johnston, Alexandra Todd-Lippock, Ellen Starbird, ElizabethSchoenecker, and Megan Schmitt of the United States Agency for International Development for theirleadership and vision to provide guidance to funders, designers, and implementers on how to effectivelyincorporate voluntary family planning into Performance-based Incentives programs. Their support andcontributions were critical and deeply appreciated. Sincere thanks to Margaret Neuse for sharing historyand providing much needed background to help ground the paper and to Lindsey Miller for helpfulsuggestions that contributed to strengthening this paper.ixThe trend to implement Performance-based Incentives (PBI) in low- and middle-income countries tostrengthen health systems, accelerate service utilization, and enhance quality of health interventionspresents an opportunity as well as a challenge for voluntary family planning (FP) service delivery and use.There is considerable opportunity, through PBI, to stimulate quality FP counseling and increase access toand availability of voluntary FP. At the same time, the challenge of introducing incentives that supportinformed voluntary choice requires careful design and ongoing monitoring. This tension should notcause policymakers to shy away from incorporating FP into PBI schemes, as there is a real danger thatexcluding FP from the schemes may result in its neglect. Given the central role FP plays in attainment ofthe Millennium Development Goals, appropriate mechanisms to incorporate FP into PBI approaches areneeded. This paper identifies the opportunities as well as the challenges of incorporating FP into PBIapproaches; discusses U.S. policies and support for enhancing access to FP; presents what is knownabout how low- and middle-income countries are including FP in PBI approaches and lessons learned;and provides suggestions for donors, policymakers, program implementers, and technical assistanceproviders about how to responsibly and effectively integrate FP into PBI programs in the developingworld.For those considering introduction of health PBI initiatives, it provides examples of programs thathave successfully incorporated FP.PBI approaches in health link payment to the achievement of predefined health results. We seearrangements with payers and recipients at different levels in health systems, each with implications andtrade-offs regarding effectiveness and cost. Donors have incorporated PBI in the way they structurepayment to countries by conditioning aid on evidence of health results and some national governmentstransfer funds to sub-national levels of government based partly on attainment of health or coveragetargets. In some fragile state contexts, donors pay nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) for resultsthat include FP. A number of developing countries reward health facilities for quality counseling andavailability and use of modern FP methods. To reduce financial barriers to accessing FP, some programssell to poor women vouchers at subsidized rates that provide access to FP and other services fromaccredited providers. Conditional cash transfer (CCT) programs provide income support to poorfamilies if they meet health and education conditions that, in some cases, include participating in healtheducation talks about FP.Because FP contributes to health and broad development goals, the case is strong to include FP as oneof the priorities in PBI approaches. Improvements in FP use results in fewer unintended pregnancies;fewer maternal and newborn deaths; healthier mothers and children; greater family savings andproductivity; and better prospects for educating children, strengthening economies, and reducing thepressure on natural resources in developing countries.By exploring details of a wide range of PBI schemes, this paper looks at how FP has been incorporated,how recipients are incentivized, impact when available, and lessons that hold relevance for otherXIsettings. PBI schemes were identified through an on-line survey that was conducted in May 2009 and byschemes known to authors. The paper provides a wide range of program examples, some fromcountries that do not receive USAID support. Therefore, USAID-supported PBI programs shouldconsider the applicability of the U.S. FP requirements if using these examples as a basis to develop PBIprogram activities. Paying for performance in FP can be introduced to incentivize actions at variouslevels in a health system. The decision about whether to introduce incentives for national-levelrecipients (e.g., a ministry of health), health facilities, or individual clients should be determined by goals;whose actions are needed to attain the goals; and relative costs, benefits, and feasibility of administeringperformance payments at various levels. The following cases are discussed:The regional Health 2015 Mesoamerica Initiative in Central America and Mexico andState Innovations in Family Planning Agency in India that describe approaches that linkfunding from donors to national- or state-level recipients to FP results.The maternal and child health insurance program for the poor in Argentina, federal tomunicipal fiscal transfers in Brazil, and incentives from national to facility levels in a pilot inZambia describe approaches that link funding from national to sub-national levels linked to FPresults.Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, Liberia, and Southern Sudanincorporate FP indicators into their PBI approaches that contract NGOs to directly deliver servicesand/or oversee service delivery in a geographic area.Voucher schemes in Pakistan and Kenya include coupons to access FP services and incorporateincentives on both the demand and supply side.PBI are used to motivate community health workers to identify pregnant women, providecounseling to women, families, and their communities, and recognize where FP demand is unmet inIndia and the Philippines.Since 1997, seven countries in Latin America and the Caribbean (Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador,Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, and Nicaragua) have implemented and evaluated CCT programswith health and nutrition components, many including FP.Many of these cases demonstrate that FP can be incorporated into PBI schemes in ways that protectvoluntary choice and are in compliance with U.S. FP requirements.Box ES-1 summarizes best practices to consider when designing a PBI scheme that incorporates FP.This paper encourages the inclusion of voluntary FP within PBI programs supported by USAID or takingplace in USAID-supported health facilities in a manner consistent with USAID FP requirements. Thepaper clarifies these requirements and provides examples of USAID-supported PBI programs wherevoluntary FP is included in a manner that is consistent with the requirements.As donors embrace the principles of country-led health plans, complemented by increased accountabilityfor results, linking payment to performance is likely to increase in prominence. We may see moreperformance-based aid, as donors condition payment to countries based on results. We may also see anincrease in national to sub-national PBI as governments exercise their influence through conditionsattached to intergovernmental fiscal transfers. At the national and sub-national levels, rewardingpopulation-level FP services coverage targets (for example, proportion of women of reproductive age ina province using FP) as well as their quality is consistent with U.S. FP requirements.Box ES-1: Best Practices to Consider When Including Voluntary FP in PBI Programs:"Dos and Don'ts"Individual client level:1. Do consider offering clients the opportunity to purchase coupons/vouchers (at full or subsidized prices) for apackage of services that includes FP. Client payments for the purchase of vouchers promote voluntary FPchoice and acceptance and can enable clients to receive services from providers they prefer, either public orprivate.2. Do consider reducing financial barriers for voluntary sterilization clients to make the method readily accessibleby subsidizing the cost of the procedure or offering reasonable compensation or in-kind support to thoseexperiencing high service delivery costs, lost wages during convalescence, high transportation costs to reach afacility, or who require food during confinement.3. Do consider offering compensation to offset the costs of transportation to enable clients to attend healtheducation sessions and to receive FP counseling.4. Do include attendance in health education sessions that discuss FP as one of the conditions of CCT programs.5. Don't pay clients or give them any benefits in exchange for accepting a method.6. Don't deny clients a benefit if they choose not to accept FP.Individual health worker level:1. Do consider paying health providers for FP services that include quality counseling as well as provision of amethod. Payment should be reasonable, where “reasonable" implies payments that are in line with paymentsfor other services. This includes compensation for services delivered to voucher clients.2. Don't reward health providers for achieving a target number of FP users or users of a particular FP method.3. Don't compensate for delivery of specific FP methods with payments that are out of line with payments forother services, as this may lead to coercive behavior.Health facility, health team, or NGO level:1. Do consider rewarding the availability of a wide range of methods.2. Do consider rewarding facilities or teams to attain performance objectives. Health facility or team targets orgoals should not be distributed to health care providers as individual targets. Consider rewarding facilities orteams to attain performance objectives specified as number of clients counseled, or number of new FP clientsaccepting FP methods. Please note: health facilities and teams have more than one health worker. For facilitieswith one health worker, refer to the guidelines for individual health workers.3. Do include FP counseling as a component of antenatal and postnatal care indicators.4. Do reward performance indicators that combine FP services provided and measures of FP quality.5. Don't compensate for delivery of specific FP methods with payments that are out of line with payments forother services, as this may lead to coercive behavior.Sub-national or national level:1. Do consider opportunities to link fiscal transfers from national to sub-national levels of government to resultsrelated to population coverage of specific methods, counseling and education, improved quality, and increasedaccess.XIIIThe trend to implement Performance-based Incentives (PBI) in low- and middle-income countries tostrengthen health systems, accelerate service utilization, and enhance quality of health interventionspresents an opportunity as well as a challenge for voluntary family planning (FP). The opportunity,through PBI, to stimulate quality FP counseling and increase access to and availability of voluntary FP isconsiderable. At the same time, the challenge of introducing incentives that support informed choicerequires careful design and ongoing monitoring. This tension should not cause policymakers to shy awayfrom incorporating FP into PBI schemes, as there is a real danger that excluding FP may result in itsneglect. Given the central role voluntary FP plays in attainment of the Millennium Development Goals(MDGs), appropriate mechanisms to incorporate voluntary FP into PBI approaches are needed. Thispaper identifies the opportunities as well as the challenges of incorporating FP into PBI approaches;discusses U.S. policies and support for enhancing access to voluntary FP; presents what is known abouthow low- and middle-income countries are including FP and lessons learned; and provides suggestionsfor donors, policymakers, program implementers, and technical assistance providers about how toresponsibly and effectively integrate voluntary FP into PBI programs in the developing world.A formal definition of PBI for health is: “Transfer of money or material goods conditional on taking ameasurable health-related action or achieving a predetermined performance target."1 Essentially, PBIapproaches link a payment to the achievement of predefined and agreed-upon results. This might meanproviding income support to poor households with conditions that specify that they attend healtheducation sessions that discuss FP or it might be a program that helps poor women overcome financialobstacles to seeking counseling or services by providing payment for transportation. It might meanpayments to health facilities if the team working at the facility succeeds in providing quality FP counselingand services to the specified portion of the population they serve. PBI may also be incorporated into theway national governments transfer funds to sub-national levels of government, with partial links toattainment of health or coverage targets that include FP. Donors have also used PBI in the way theystructure payment to countries and links to FP results can be incorporated.Why has interest in PBI intensified recently? Global commitment to achieve the health MDGs is one ofthe drivers behind interest in PBI as countries recognize that current health system strengthening/healthfinancing approaches will not produce desired results. Optimism has resulted from evaluations ofconditional cash transfer (CCT) schemes in Latin America that demonstrate that linking incometransfers to health and education conditions can produce encouraging results (Glassman et al. 2009,Regalia and Castro 2009). Supply-side schemes that link payment to service delivery nongovernmentalorganizations (NGOs) to achievement of results in Afghanistan (Sondorp et al. 2009) and Haiti (Eichleret al. 2009) are also promising. A recent rigorous evaluation of the impact of the now scaled-up nationalapproach in Rwanda suggests that PBI contributes to improvements in service utilization and quality,including new and continuing use of FP (Basinga et al. April 2009). This growing body of evidence adds to1the common sense appeal of PBI as a complement to the training and investment in inputs that has beenmuch of the focus on health system strengthening in recent decades.PBI is especially useful in health services environments where the existing incentives do not elicit hardwork and where bureaucratic systems thwart individual initiative. Linking a portion of payment toachieving health results and, at the same time, allowing recipients the flexibility and autonomy torespond to incentives may catalyze actions that overcome many health system weaknesses. For example,civil service structures in many developing countries provide relatively low fixed salaries that do not varyif a health worker is a stellar performer or a bad one. Add to this that people lose their jobs only forserious misconduct and the result is a weak incentive environment for the most internally driven and anoutright dysfunctional incentive environment for most others. NGOs are often paid for documentedspending on inputs, rather than for producing results. A shift to accountability for results by a paymentsystem that rewards results can stimulate changes in the behaviors of institutions and the individuals thatwork within them. Intergovernmental transfers can be powerful levers to catalyze accountability forresults and the systems to achieve results at sub-national levels of government.Rewarding FP results through PBI approaches involves more complex behaviors by clients and serviceproviders than rewards for services that are more time limited and subject to less complex social, intra-household, and community dynamics, such as child immunization and vitamin A supplementation. Forclients, the decision to seek counseling for FP, followed by choice of a method and its continued use,requires a complex series of behaviors and actions that include appreciation of the benefits of FP,support from families and communities, repeated actions to use the chosen method, and the ability toovercome barriers to accessing services. Incentives can overcome financial access barriers andstrengthen understanding and perceived value by rewarding participation in health education talks. Onthe service provision side, providers need to deliver quality counseling, ensure availability ofcommodities, and have the technical competence to deliver chosen methods. Performance incentivescan increase availability of FP counseling and methods and have the potential to improve quality.Because incentives can be a potentially powerful tool, it is critical to consider the purpose of theincentives and monitor unintended consequences as well as those intended. Potential pitfalls of PBIprograms related to voluntary FP include the following:Providers may focus on rewarded services and neglect other important services. PBI schemes thatleave out FP may find that providers neglect provision of voluntary FP services, contributing tostagnating FP use, while the use of other rewarded services rises.Poorly designed PBI incentives may result in excessive attention to increasing voluntary FP use,resulting in coercive behavior by managers and providers that interferes with voluntary choice byclients.PBI may damage the intrinsic motivation of providers and cause them to view health care delivery,including provision of FP services, as piece work.The quality of information systems may be compromised as the incentives to report the FP resultsfor which providers are rewarded may cause them to falsify reported information.Without clear communication, clients may incorrectly interpret the offer to cover transportationcosts to access counseling or specific services (e.g., voluntary sterilization) as payment to accept amethod.These potential pitfalls can be mitigated with smart design and ongoing monitoring and assessment ofboth intended and unintended effects.Many PBI schemes in developing countries, some mature and others in the early phases of design orimplementation, are currently rewarding improved FP results. Evidence presented in this paper comesfrom the authors' knowledge of schemes and from responses to a recent on-line survey that identifiedeight programs (some countries have multiple approaches) that incorporate FP indicators and 17 thatinclude low contraceptive use as a “health concern targeted by the PBI intervention" (Beith et al. 2009).A wide range of approaches are being tried such as:Women are sold vouchers by voucher distributors at subsidized rates that enable them to accessFP services at private and/or public facilities (e.g., in Kenya, Pakistan).NGOs are contracted to provide services and rewarded to reduce FP discontinuation, increase FPutilization and, in some cases, improve quality of services (e.g., in Bangladesh, Burundi, DemocraticRepublic of Congo, Haiti, Kenya, Pakistan, Rwanda).Public sector providers receive money when FP measures, such as new and continuing FP use, areachieved (e.g., in Burundi, DR Congo, Egypt, Kenya, Pakistan, Rwanda, Zambia)Fiscal transfers from national to sub-national levels of government are linked to FP performance(Argentina, Brazil) and funding from donors to countries is partly conditioned on FP results(regional initiative in Central America and Mexico, India)Community health workers are rewarded for ensuring that women receive a comprehensivepackage of maternal health services that include FP counseling (India, Philippines).Section 2 presents the importance of voluntary FP in health and development. Section 3 discusses U.S.FP requirements and presents a brief history of the development of both Policy Determination 3 andAddendum: USAID Policy Guidelines on Voluntary Sterilization (PD-3) and the Tiahrt Amendment. Section 4presents a framework to organize PBI approaches that include voluntary FP and shares snapshots ofthese approaches that include program goals, indicators, payment approaches, and results, whenavailable. Section 5 concludes the paper with a call for new measures that enable rewards for quality FPcounseling and service provision as well as the quantity measures in predominant use and reiterates thecall to include voluntary FP in PBI schemes. By providing clarity on the challenges and opportunities ofPBI for voluntary FP, we hope to offer some strategies on how to most effectively move forward toincorporate FP indicators into PBI approaches in a manner that ensures voluntarism and informedchoice. An annex is included that presents an overview of the history of support for voluntary FP in theUnited States with an eye toward identifying lessons relevant for FP programs in developing countries.32. CONTRIBUTION OF FP TOACHIEVING THE HEALTH MDGSFP is an important vehicle for advancing maternal and child health and contributes to overalldevelopment. Evidence supporting investments in FP combined with significant global unmet need,motivated creation of MDG 5b, which calls for universal access to reproductive health and incorporatesFP goals of increasing contraceptive prevalence rates, reducing adolescent birth rates, and satisfyingunmet need for FP. Increased FP use results in fewer unintended pregnancies; fewer maternal andnewborn deaths; healthier mothers and children; greater family savings and productivity; and betterprospects for educating children, strengthening economies, and reducing the pressure on naturalresources in developing countries. Because of these far-reaching benefits, increased investment in FP andmaternal and newborn health services has the potential to accelerate progress toward achieving theMDGs by 2015. Using estimates from 2008, a recent report, Adding It Up (Singh et al. 2009) shows that:Despite increases in FP use in recent years, an estimated 215 million women who want to avoid apregnancy are not using an effective method of contraception;About 20 million women have unsafe abortions each year, and 3 million of the estimated 8.5 millionwho need care for subsequent health complications, do not receive it.The direct health benefits of meeting the need for FP and maternal and newborn health services wouldalso be dramatic. It is estimated that, if this need were met:Unintended pregnancies would drop by more than two-thirds, from 75 million in 2008 to 22 millionper year.Forty-four percent of newborn deaths would be averted  a decline from 3.5 million to 1.9 million.Unsafe abortions would decline by 73 percent, from 20 million to 5.5 million (assuming no changein abortion laws), and the number of women needing medical care for complications of unsafeprocedures would decline from 8.5 million to 2 million.More women would survive hemorrhage and infection, and fewer would endure needless sufferingfrom fistula, infertility, and other health problems related to pregnancy or childbirth.While the benefits of increasing access to FP information and services are clear, is also clear thatcontinuing with “business as usual" will not fill the need gap. This is true for a range of priority healthinterventions in addition to FP. One promising solution that a number of countries are using tostrengthen health systems is PBI supply- and demand-side incentive approaches of various forms. Thispaper hopes to shed light on “What is PBI and how are countries, in particular developing countries,using it to increase access to FP in a way that ensures voluntarism and informed choice?"53. USAID FP POLICIES RELATED TOVOLUNTARISM AND INFORMEDCHOICEThis section covers the statutes and policies of the United States Agency for International Development(USAID) that most directly pertain to PBI schemes and the motivations behind their enactment. It beginswith a bit of the history that motivated introduction of policies in 1982 that provided guidance on howUSAID funding should be used to support informed consent and protect voluntarism. These policieswere further elaborated within U.S. statutes in 1998 to clarify standards that protect client voluntarychoice. Including voluntary FP within a USAID-supported PBI program can be acceptable if it takes careto ensure compliance with the 1998 Tiahrt Amendment and respects voluntarism and informed choiceof FP services. This has been done successfully in a number of cases, many described in the pages thatfollow. Understanding these rules and the history behind them is relevant to all who wish to protectvoluntarism.In the early years of national FP programs, some developing countries, notably Bangladesh and India,introduced incentive payments for both providers and individuals for surgical sterilization. Payments toproviders were designed to overcome provider resistance to offering FP services, especially voluntarysterilization, and encourage increases in availability of all FP services. Payments to compensate for travelcosts and the value of lost wages during the recovery period were also made to individual clients whoreceived voluntary surgical sterilization. At the time, voluntary sterilization services were offered in onlya relatively few sites and, given that it was a surgical procedure, required several days of convalescence.The practice of rewarding providers for achieving specific contraceptive targets, especially for such apermanent and provider-dependent method as sterilization, created serious concerns that paymentscould lead providers to coerce clients to accept specific contraceptive methods, notably sterilization.Such concerns were voiced by supporters of organized FP assistance (see Cleland and Mauldin 1991) aswell as by its critics (cf. Hartman 1985; Warwick 1982). Provider payments for sterilization were alsothought to bias the presentation of information about sterilization in comparison with other methods.However, there is little evidence supporting the concern that such compensation schemes havepromoted reliance on sterilization. Indeed, one of the countries whose sterilization practices were mostcriticized, Bangladesh, has in fact seen a steady decline in sterilization use despite the persistence of bothprovider and client reimbursement for the service (see EngenderHealth 2002, p. 5-6).To ensure the practice of informed consent and to protect voluntarism in the provision of sterilizationservices, USAID introduced agency policy in 1982: Policy Determination 3 and Addendum: USAID PolicyGuidelines on Voluntary Sterilization.2 PD-3 lays out agency guidelines on a number of issues, includingpayments related to voluntary sterilization. The addendum clarifies PD-3 and elaborates detailedprogram guidelines regarding acceptable practice for payment of acceptors, payment of providers ofservices, and “payment of referral agents." The paper establishes that payments per case or perprocedure to providers of voluntary sterilization services are acceptable if the payments are“reasonable." While acknowledging the acceptability of the practice (given the “customary" nature of7reimbursement for health procedures), the document advises USAID missions to “encourage patterns ofservice delivery and methods of payment which do not unduly emphasize voluntary sterilization servicescompared to other methods of ‘fertility control.'" PD-3 specifically mentions several measures formitigating the risk of such payments functioning as incentives. These include separating the selection andcounseling of clients from the provision of the service and structuring reimbursement for providers ofFP “per counseling session" rather than for acceptance of a specific method.Policy and practice regarding the acceptability of payments to FP providers continued to be guided solelyby PD-3 until the late 1990s. In October 1998, members of Congress responded to evidence of non-voluntary practices in the Peruvian FP program with the introduction of a statutory amendment, knownas the “Tiahrt Amendment." The Tiahrt Amendment reaffirms and further elaborates standards forvoluntary FP service delivery programs to protect FP “acceptors," defined as individual clients receivingservices. Statute language has consistently been enacted unchanged in subsequent annual appropriationslegislation to date. Two provisions of the Tiahrt Amendment are directly relevant to PBI in USAID-funded projects:31) Service providers or referral agents shall not implement or be subject to numerical targets orquotas of total number of births, number of FP acceptors, or acceptors of a particular FP method.Quantitative estimates or indicators used for budgeting or planning purposes are permissible.2) No incentives, bribes, gratuities, or financial reward for FP program personnel for achieving targetsor quotas, or for individuals in exchange for becoming a FP acceptor.The amendment requires that, within 60 days after the USAID Administrator determines that a singleviolation of either of these requirements has occurred, the Administrator must submit a report toCongress describing the violation and corrective actions taken to address it.4The Tiahrt Amendment enjoys bipartisan support. To ensure voluntarism in its programs, includingcompliance with the Tiahrt Amendment, USAID stepped up its internal training on all U.S. FPrequirements and enhanced monitoring of compliance with all statutes and policies that guide its FPprogram. To date, three Tiahrt Amendment violations have been reported to Congress by USAID.Heightened awareness of the statutes and policies, including the Tiahrt Amendment, strong Agencyemphasis on voluntarism, and limited knowledge of PBI as a new way of doing business have initiallycombined to create hesitation to include FP in such schemes by those who want to ensure voluntarismwithin USAID's FP programs and compliance with the Tiahrt Amendment requirements.More recently, momentum is building to support health system strengthening interventions that enhancepriority health programs. A number of USAID-supported programs are incorporating innovativefinancing approaches such as PBI to strengthen health systems and improve provider and programperformance. There is also a greater understanding of how PBI initiatives can be operationalized andpotential results, building on recent (yet limited) evaluations and reporting of results of PBI initiatives,growing experience developing PBI programs, greater support for health system strengthening, and newopenness to innovation.U.S. FP requirements, including the Tiahrt Amendment, offer wide opportunities for including voluntaryFP with PBI initiatives. PBI programs funded or carried out in USAID-supported service delivery projectsmust not include provider- or referral-level targets for number of FP acceptors or acceptors of specificFP methods and demand-side PBI initiatives must not provide benefits in exchange for accepting FPThe full text of the Tiahrt Amendment appears in http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/pop/fy99lang.pdfSee http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/pop/voluntariness.html.methods, but many other options remain for successfully incorporating FP indicators and activities in PBIinitiatives. For example, incentives can be linked to ensuring availability of a choice of modern methodsor for quality counseling. Fee-for-service provider payments linked to provision of voluntary FP servicesare also feasible, provided that they are in line with fees for other services. Subsidies to cover clients'costs of transportation are possible, as long as payment for transportation is not linked to acceptance ofa method and free services can be provided. PBI initiatives have wide latitude for including FP indicatorsand activities to increase demand for voluntary FP services. PBI programs often include related behaviorchange communication and information, education and communication activities where FP messagesshould be included to increase information and demand for voluntary FP. Technical assistance activitieswithin PBI initiatives should also include modules on ensuring FP voluntarism and informed choice withinhigh-quality, client-centered health servicesBox 1: Guidance for USAID Missions, Contractors, and Recipients of USAID FP AssistanceFamiliarization with current U.S. FP requirements and related guidance is easy and should be the first step inbuilding compliance into PBI program design. The USAID external web site provides links to the policy languagethat governs the use of FP assistance and outlines USAID's guiding principles:http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/pop/index.html#.The USAID external web site also includes a link to two specific guidance documents related to the TiahrtAmendment: “Guidance for Implementing the ‘Tiahrt' Requirements for Voluntary Family Planning Projects" and“Technical Guidance on the ‘Comprehensible Information' Paragraph of the Tiahrt Clause."In addition, USAID's Global Health E-Learning Center, www.globalhealthlearning.org, includes an e-learningcourse on the U.S. FP requirements. This publicly available course includes information on all the U.S. FPrequirements, including the Tiahrt Amendment.USAID Missions should keep communication lines open with implementing partners in order to address questionsor issues that may arise during PBI program development or implementation. USAID Mission staff are stronglyencouraged to contact their Regional Legal Advisor (RLA), and/or the Senior Policy Advisor (GH/PRH) atUSAID/Washington, for further assistance addressing compliance or other policy-related questions.94. FP IN PBI SCHEMES IN DEVELOPINGCOUNTRIESThe authors are aware of many developing country health PBI schemes that include FP as an importantelement, often within a package of maternal health services. We see schemes that are fully private, fullypublic, and those that involve partnerships between public and private sectors. While most have beenintroduced within the past few years, some have been implemented for much longer. And while manybegin with pilots, others are being introduced at scale, and still others have expanded to scale afterpromising pilot results. The vast majority involve supply-side incentives and a few also incorporatedemand-side incentives aimed at overcoming financial obstacles poor women face or increasingunderstanding of FP benefits. This section will describe how these schemes work and, where available,present impact on measures of FP. Also highlighted are pitfalls, challenges, and lessons that can be ofinterest to others planning to introduce a FP component to an already existing or planned health sectorPBI scheme.While this section presents descriptions of how FP is being incorporated in PBI schemes, theseexamples should not be considered examples of “best practices," nor are they intended to be used toguide programs that USAID Missions may adopt. They present evidence of “what is" and not necessarily“what should be." As programs evolve, we can expect to continue to learn about new innovativeapproaches.Table 1 presents a snapshot of PBI programs in developing countries that incorporate FP, by region. Amore detailed discussion of schemes by category follows.The following discussion categorizes developing-country PBI schemes that include FP by type of payerand primary recipient of the performance-based payment. This structure provides a way to organize theevidence as well as provides a menu of options to consider. There are cases of external donors fundingcountries, sub-national levels of government, and NGOs based on performance related to a package ofservices that includes FP. We also see transfers from national to sub-national levels of governmentpartly linked to FP results. There are a number of examples of payment from a government or healthinsurer to health facilities and to community health workers linked to attainment of health results thatinclude FP. We also see a few examples of demand-side PBI, in which funds are provided to clients to11Within each category, we provide as much information as we have about the goals of the programincluding the justification for paying incentives to the chosen recipients. We describe features of thedesign such as indicators, payment rules, and how performance is monitored and validated. Followingdiscussion of the design elements, we describe what we know about implementation arrangements: the“how" and “who." When available, we also include results and lessons learned.4.1. PBA FROM EXTERNAL FUNDER TO NATIONAL OR SUB-NATIONAL LEVEL OF GOVERNMENTPerformance-based Aid (PBA), which provides funding from an external donor to a national or sub-national level of government conditional on achieved results, embodies assumptions that incentives atthis “higher" level will catalyze changes in leadership, planning, management, and systems that will resultin improved health and, specifically, FP results. The evidence on the effectiveness of PBA, however, is farfrom clear, partly because incentives provided at this higher level do not appear to trickle down to affectbehaviors of providers and clients (Eichler and Glassman 2008).A new initiative that will include FP was in the design stage when this paper was being written. Health2015 Mesoamerica, funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Instituto Carlos Slim de laSalud and managed by the Inter-American Development Bank, aims to avoid weaknesses observed withother examples of PBA that failed to ensure that incentives change behaviors where change is mostneeded  at the level of the service delivery-client interface.5 Payments to governments in CentralAmerica and poor states of Mexico will be linked partly to results that will include FP if FP is a selectedpriority of the national or state government that is the potential recipient of performance awards.Contracts between Health 2015 Mesoamerica and country and state governments intend to specify thatincentives must be transferred to lower levels of the system. While contract terms and actual indicatorsare not yet determined, this approach has the potential for much cross-country learning within theCentral American region and beyond. It is also planned to be an interesting model of donor fundinglinked to country-level performance that incorporates a contractual requirement that specifies thatincentives reach the service delivery-client interface.In India, USAID has implemented a form of PBA termed “performance-based disbursement," whichprovides funding to a state-level registered society (Indian parastatal) linked to attainment of specifiedbenchmarks. The State Innovations in Family Planning Agency (SIFPSA) was formed to receive USAIDfunding ($325 million over the first 10 years beginning in 1994) and to implement state-level FP activitiesin Uttar Pradesh aimed at reducing fertility by expanding access to and improving quality of FP services(Rowan 2009). In 2002, SIFPSA grew to serve Uttarakhand and Jharkhand and to cover a broader set ofmaternal and child health activities. SIFPSA's responsibility is to develop plans to increase FP access, use,and quality and to contract a range of public and private entities to implement activities.During the initial phase of development, SIFPSA received support to establish itself as a functioningorganization. Early benchmarks were related to priorities such as development of management systemsand procedures, planning, and staffing. Ongoing benchmarks related to process measures such as“number of people trained," “NGO contracted and funds disbursed," “development of a mediacampaign," and “introduce quality improvement systems" as well as to measures of FP use throughmechanisms such as social franchising. Each benchmark in the annual plan is costed and associated fundsare disbursed after the benchmark is achieved. The majority of the measures are process oriented. Insome contracts, SIFPSA incorporates financial incentives to reward the results the subcontracted entityis accountable to achieve.13PERFORMANCE-BASED FISCAL TRANSFERS FROMNATIONAL TO SUB-NATIONAL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENTNational governments can incorporate PBI into the methods used to determine transfers of federalfunds to states and municipalities. This may be especially useful in settings where top-down approachesto health are not feasible due to factors such as sheer size of countries (e.g., India) or decentralizationthat transfers responsibility for health to sub-national levels of government. By linking federal-to-statefiscal transfers to results, national governments can exert influence by providing incentives to hold lowerlevels of government accountable while preserving the principle of direct management of health at thestate level. Effective performance-based fiscal transfers can stimulate state health leaders to identify andfix systemic weaknesses and bottlenecks. If not carefully designed and implemented, however,performance-based transfers can have the same challenges as PBA described above. If the incentives donot translate into health-improving actions at the interface between providers and clients, performance-based inter-governmental transfers will have little impact.In Argentina, the federal government transfers funds to provinces partly based on enrollment in amaternal and child health insurance program, Plan Nacer, and partly based on achievement of 10 tracerindicators, one of which is counseling for sexual and reproductive health. The goals of this program areto reduce the infant and maternal mortality rate; strengthen the incentive framework for efficiency andenhance focus on results between the national level and participating provinces and between provincesand service providers; and strengthen the stewardship capacity of national and provincial ministries ofhealth. Plan Nacer began as a World Bank project in 2002 with intentions to transition to fullgovernment funding.After signing an annual performance agreement with the National Ministry of Health, provincesimplement a system to enroll beneficiaries, and design and implement a health service purchasingfunction in the Provincial Ministry of Health. Annual performance agreements specify yearly results andenrollment goals, targets for tracers, prices for services, annual work programs, and yearly projectedbudgets. Provinces negotiate quarterly targets, expressed as a proportion of the total eligible population,with the National Ministry of Health. Each province sets up a “provincial purchasing unit" to overseeimplementation of Plan Nacer at the province level. The responsibilities of the provincial purchasing unitare to (i) identify and enroll beneficiaries; (ii) identify, authorize, and contract with service providers, (iii)control the technical quality of services, financial management, and procurement, and (iv) obtaintechnical financial and administrative support.Plan Nacer covers a benefits package that includes 80 health services that improve maternal and childhealth. Of the per capita payment of roughly $10 per person/per month (the average cost of providingthe defined package of benefits), 60 percent is transferred based on submission of enrollment lists thatshow numbers of poor women and children enrolled in the scheme and the remaining 40 percent islinked to evidence of achievement on 10 performance targets, with the FP-related target “proportion ofreproductive age women that receive sexual and reproductive care consultations." Achievement of eachtarget is linked to 4 percent (4 * 10 = 40%).As in all approaches that link funding to evidence of results, an effective system to monitor and validatereported results is critical. In Argentina's Plan Nacer program, enrollment of the target population iscrosschecked by examining enrollment registers of other social insurance schemes. Penalties formisreporting enrollment are return of the per capita transfer plus an additional 20 percent penalty.Provinces collect and report output information for each tracer, following explicit guidelines from thenational program (and assistance to build the required information, verification, and reporting systems).An external auditor examines a sample of registrations (enrollment and tracers) for verification. TheNational Ministry of Health also conducts a concurrent audit using internal staff.By 2009, Plan Nacer enrolled 80 percent of the target population in five states (1 million enrollees in2009). Performance on tracers surpassed targets for six out of 10 indicators.Plan Nacer is an exciting and innovative program that expands coverage and access to services by poorwomen and children by subsidizing premiums in a targeted social insurance program, specifying the rulesfor transfers of funds from national to province level, and creating health purchasers at the provincelevel who negotiate with and pay providers for a defined list of services. However, the devil is in thedetails and the implementation “machinery" needs attention. The details to validate data and holdprovinces accountable are critical: The 60 percent transfer upon enrollment ended up building up largepools of funds in the provincial account. This growing pool then became a source of political pressure asthe national government, the press, and civil society organizations quickly began pressuring provinces tospend this money on services for enrolled beneficiaries.6 In addition, this strategy enables the centralgovernment to have influence over health in provinces that are decentralized providing a clear oversightand guidance role for the Ministry of Health while still transferring control over resources and local-level decisions to the provinces. Perhaps most important is that Plan Nacer profoundly changed the rolesof key actors and shifted focus to results, strengthening the long-term capacity of the health system.In Brazil, the federal government has incorporated performance-based transfers to municipalities since1998 to stimulate expansion of a Family Health Program that provides maternal health and FP services.As population coverage by Family Health Teams increases, municipalities receive higher transfers perteam per year, providing incentives to expand the program and serve the poorest Brazilians.Between 1994 and 2008, the proportion of the population covered by Family Health Teams expandedfrom zero to 31 percent.Beginning in 2009, Brazil is piloting an enhanced incentive scheme that links funding to performance oneight indicators that cover effectiveness (health outputs), efficiency (reduced hospital admissions), andmanagement. FP is not explicitly incentivized; however, it continues to be included in the package ofservices provided by Family Health Teams.Many insights throughout come from discussion with Cristian Baeza, then lead health specialist of the World Bank, whodesigned this Adaptable Program Loan (APL).15In Zambia, a pilot has been designed and will soon be implemented that establishes performanceincentives for regional health teams and district health teams that are aligned with performanceincentives for health facilities. Facilities will have the opportunity to earn fees for each new FP acceptor.In addition, a quality assessment tool is being developed to incentivize quality counseling as part of thefull package of services. This approach is designed to motivate health actors at each level of the systemto resolve bottlenecks, work hard, and strengthen the performance of the health system, with a focuson maternal and newborn health, including FP.This pilot, supported by Norway and the U.K. Department for International Development (DFID)through a World Bank-managed “Health Results Innovation Trust Fund," will examine the impact of PBIin nine districts of Zambia as compared with two groups of controls (nine districts receive the samefunding as the PBI districts but with no performance conditions and nine other districts continue with“business as usual"). Regional health teams and district health teams will also be rewarded withincentives to provide the supervision and technical support to help facilities achieve performance goals.Facilities will earn fees for a list of services in addition to the fixed budget and health worker salaries.Performance fees earned by facilities will be partly used to invest in the facility and in communityoutreach activities and will be partly shared by facility workers.4.3. CONTRACTING NGOS AND PAYING PARTLY BASED ONDOCUMENTED RESULTS IN FRAGILE, LOW-RESOURCESETTINGSIn low-resource settings with limited health infrastructure, increasing access to FP commodities may beone of the most effective strategies to reduce both maternal and child mortality. Many FP commoditiescan be distributed by community health workers and through other product distribution channels thatalready exist at village level, making scale-up easier and faster than, for example, investing ininfrastructure to manage emergency deliveries and in training highly skilled health workers. InAfghanistan (with World Bank support), DR Congo (World Bank), Haiti (USAID), Liberia (USAID),and Southern Sudan (USAID and World Bank), NGOs are contracted to directly deliver servicesand/or oversee service delivery in a geographic area. This sometimes includes paying incentives andproviding support to public health teams and public facilities as well as second-tier contracts to servicedelivery NGOs. These settings have in common a relatively weak public service delivery system and ahistory of relatively strong NGOs delivering services in the context of fragility from conflict or lack ofgovernment leadership. Contracting NGOs and paying based on results has proven to be an effectivestrategy to ensure that services reach the population in fragile contexts. In some settings (Afghanistanand Liberia), NGO contracting has also been effectively used to bolster the steering role of the nationalMinistry of Health. What follows is a brief description of each of these models with emphasis on therole of voluntary FP.In 2002, donors and the nascent Afghanistan Ministry of Public Health decided to contract NGOs toprovide access to a package of essential health services that includes increasing access to FP. Distinctcontractual approaches were adopted by three donors (European Union, World Bank, and USAID),enabling comparison across approaches (Sondorp et al., 2009). The World Bank incorporated a true PBIapproach that provided the opportunity for NGOs that received contracts to deliver services in anentire province to earn a performance bonus based on how they performed on a “balanced scorecard"(BSC). The BSC considers 28 indicators along six domains. In the “capacity for service delivery" domainis one indicator termed the “FP availability index." NGOs are paid based on a fixed and reliable budgetwith a small portion linked to results. Original architects of this model now question whether puttingmore funding at risk might generate larger results.7 Confounders such as variations in security make itdifficult to unambiguously conclude the PBI approach was more effective than the approaches adoptedby the European Union and USAID. However, the major donors are converging on a unified approachthat incorporates rewards for results.The FP availability index measures the availability of FP supplies in health facilities. The index assigns onepoint for each of the following items if they were in stock “throughout the last month": condoms; oralcontraceptive pills; Depot Medroxy Progrestrone Acetate (DMPA), an injectable contraceptive; andintrauterine devices (IUDs). The range of scores possible for each facility is 0-4. Figure 2 shows a steadyincrease in availability of modern methods from 2004 to 2008 as measured by the FP availability index.FIGURE 2: AFGHANISTAN FP AVAILABILITY INDEX FROM BSC RESULTS (200408)The DR Congo has a relatively long history of contracting out management of health in geographicregions. Currently (in 2010) the European Union, the World Bank, and Cordaid are supporting PBIprograms in different parts of the country through various NGOs that include FP.17Since 2007, the European Union is funding a PBI program in North Kivu, Kasai Orientale, KasaiOccidentale, and Orientale provinces of DR Congo. The program contracts seven NGOs to overseedelivery of health services that includes FP. PBI in DR Congo, known as l'approche contractuelle, wasdesigned to address maternal health including FP, child health, infectious diseases, and chronicconditions. Incentives target three levels in the health system: zonal health teams and provincial healthteams, health centers, and reference hospitals. Zonal and provincial health teams can earn bonuseslinked to attainment of targets. Health centers and hospitals receive fees for each service provided on alist. Fees are included for the following FP services: tubal ligation and vasectomies, new and continuingFP users, and IUDs and implants. Funds for these services are transferred to the facility level and areused for facility costs, transportation, and bonus payments for health workers (Kwete and Hsi 2010).This approach suffers from payment delays, problems with verification of data, and tensions betweenhealth teams and facility staff. One design challenge is the conflict of interest that exists when healthteams are responsible for verifying the health facility results that they also are paid for achieving. Theproject has funding through 2010.In 1999, USAID shifted its approach, in a long-running project managed by Management Sciences forHealth (MSH), to contracting NGOs in Haiti from paying for documented spending on inputs to payingfor achievement of output and performance results. In the initial phase, FP indicators were rewarded.However, in subsequent years, FP was dropped from the list of rewarded indicators because of amisunderstanding that PBI of any type linked to indicators of FP would violate the Tiahrt Amendmentand a concern that FP indicators might be misinterpreted and inappropriately implemented in the localcontext. The PBI approach in Haiti, and how it evolved, contains lessons for PBI programs as well asinsight into what may happen if FP is left off the list of rewarded services (Eichler et al. 2009).PBI in Haiti began with a pilot with three NGOs that provided services to roughly 500,000 people.Additional NGOs were progressively graduated into a PBI payment regime until 2005, when all healthservice delivery NGOs supported by USAID were paid based on results. This approach continued andPBI with the public sector was planned until the devastation brought by the earthquake in January 2010.Payment consists of a portion that is regular and reliable and paid in four lump sum quarterly payments,and an annual award fee that is based on whether targets that were established at contract signing areachieved. Through 2005, roughly 95 percent of an NGO's historical budget was regular and reliable withthe opportunity to earn the 5 percent withheld amount plus an additional 5 percent bonus linked toattainment of performance targets. After 2005, the withheld amount increased to 6 percent (94 percentregular and reliable) and up to an additional 6 percent could be earned if all targets were reached.Targets are established relative to each NGO's baseline level from the previous contract period. Eachtarget has a performance payment associated with it and payment for attainment of each target is “all ornothing."Two FP indicators were included in the pilot phase in Haiti: (i) all service delivery points have availabilityof at least five modern FP methods (measured by facility stock audit), and (ii) reduced FP discontinuationrate (measured by FP register review). The first indicator was reached by all the NGOs and, for thisreason, was not included in future years. The second indicator was designed to motivate better clientcommunication and more effective counseling with the goal of reducing FP discontinuation. It providedincentives to deliver quality services to women who had already chosen to use a modern method andaimed to reduce the drop-out rate slightly (and by no means eliminate discontinuation when womenwanted to get pregnant). As explained above, FP was dropped from the list of rewarded indicators afterthe pilot year because of a misunderstanding that PBI of any type linked to indicators of FP would violatethe Tiahrt Amendment and a concern that incentivizing FP might be inappropriately implemented in thelocal context. Ongoing tracking of a more comprehensive list of indicators than the ones connected withperformance awards enabled examination of performance trends for FP. Because FP was eliminatedfrom the list of rewarded services, this analysis show increases for rewarded health indicators while FPperformance remained stagnant. This suggests that providers focused efforts on improving performanceof rewarded services and possibly neglected FP. The experience in Haiti suggests that failure to includevoluntary FP was a missed opportunity and that identifying indicators of FP that can be responsiblyincorporated into PBI programs is a priority  especially in environments where incentives are alsolinked to other services.Liberia and Southern Sudan are the newest examples of governments that are contracting NGOs todeliver health services that include incentives linked to FP. Both are using an approach with somesimilarities to what is used in Haiti. Liberia awarded contracts to NGOs to oversee delivery of servicesat the county level. A full package of services that includes FP is funded with a subset linked to aperformance payment. USAID contracts in Liberia provide full funding for the activities in each contract(as compared with including a “withheld" amount as is done in Haiti) and use the performance paymentas an added sweetener. A potential performance payment is linked to the FP indicator, “number of siteswith staff member competent to provide counseling on informed choice for family planning."8 As thecontracts had not completed the first full year at the time of writing this report, no results are availableon the effectiveness of this indicator and approach.In 2009, USAID awarded a project to MSH to support performance-based provision of health services inSouthern Sudan by paying NGOs to deliver services that include FP to a geographic region ofSouthern Sudan. The approach is to establish performance targets for a package of primary healthservices and to reward NGOs each quarter for attainment of performance targets. NGOs will have afixed price contract that is based on reasonable costs of providing the full package of services in theregions they serve. This fixed price portion will be provided in regular and reliable quarterly paymentsconditional on certain deliverables such as reporting. In addition, NGOs will have the opportunity toearn up to an additional 6 percent of the value of the annual fixed price budget if they attain or surpasstheir performance targets. Performance payments are at the level of an NGO that has multiple servicedelivery points.19In addition to a range of child health, maternal health, malaria, nutrition, hygiene and sanitation,HIV/AIDS prevention, and health systems strengthening indicators, the following five FP/birth spacingindicators are included:Assessment of U.S. government (USG)-assisted clinic facilities' compliance with clinical standards (inSouthern Sudan, must have at least four methods available)NGOs have responsibility for delivering services in a geographic region of Southern Sudan and indicatorsand targets are set for a large geographic area. NGOs will report achievement on the full list ofindicators each quarter. However, to manage the logistical and financing costs of ongoing validation, asubset of indicators will be randomly selected each quarter for verification. Readers should note that theseindicators would be inappropriate if used to incentivize individual health workers.A number of challenges, which are likely relevant for other post-conflict and fragile states, have delayedfinal agreement on the terms of contracts with NGOs.9 The first is that it is difficult to derive robustestimates of the cost of delivering services in challenging environments with limited infrastructure (e.g.,few roads), few trained health workers, weak management capacity, rudimentary information systems,etc. Information to reliably determine budgets is more important when paying lump-sum fixed-pricecontracts than in environments where reimbursement is for documented spending. A second challengeis that some NGOs are reluctant to commit to achieving performance targets when they do not controlthe supply of inputs that are essential for achieving targets, such as bednets and vitamin A. A thirdchallenge is that seasonal variation makes access and delivery of health services almost impossible duringsome parts of the year, causing NGOs to be reluctant to commit to quarterly targets that are notfeasible to achieve during the period. A fourth challenge is that reliable population figures(denominators) required for obtaining intervention coverage estimates do not exist and baselineperformance data are unreliable.Driven by the desire to improve health results that includes FP, often with a focus on the health MDGs,a number of national governments are scaling up PBI approaches in their public systems. In somesettings, private providers, including NGOs and faith-based organizations, are also incorporated. BeforePBI is introduced, public health facility staff in most public settings receive a fixed salary that does notvary by whether they do a good or poor job and, in many cases, is not impacted if they work less thantheir full shift or are frequently absent. This dysfunctional incentive environment predictably does notgenerate intensive efforts to provide quality FP and other health services. To address this poorperformance, some governments are implementing performance incentives. In many cases, countriesbegin with pilots and revise and refine as they evaluate and learn before scaling up.In Rwanda and Burundi national governments (or donors following a standardized national approach)pay additional fees to health facilities (per service delivered) linked to delivery of a list of priorityservices that include new and continuing FP users and, in Burundi, specified methods. In Rwanda, thefees are discounted by quality assessment scores and in Burundi facilities have the opportunity to earnan additional bonus for performance on quality assessments. In all settings, facility-level payments arepartly used to reward health workers. In Egypt, as part of the strategy to roll out a new family healthmodel, health facilities providing this integrated care model have the opportunity to earn performancebonuses linked to attainment of health targets (including FP) and these performance payments aredistributed partly to individual staff. Honduras has implemented a PBI strategy aimed at improvingquality in public hospitals that incorporates FP indicators.Perhaps most well known because of the recent impact evaluation that has been widely disseminated,Rwanda has scaled up a unified national PBI model that pays health facilities (public and private) fees fora list of services and then assesses quality and applies the quality score to discount fees (Basinga andVermeesch 2009, Basinga et al. 2009). Increasing access to FP is a government priority reflected in howdistrict political leaders are accountable to the national level as well as inclusion of FP in the package ofservices rewarded with performance-based financing fees in health facilities. Included in the list ofrewarded services at the health center level are fees for new FP acceptors and additional fees forresupply of FP. In addition, a measure of quality of FP is assessed that assigns weights to both astructural component of FP (such as commodity availability) and a process component assessed throughmedical record review.PBI in Rwanda began in 2002 with two donor-funded and NGO-implemented pilots with different designand implementation arrangements. After both models showed better results than in comparable districtswithout PBI, and after promising results from a third pilot that began in 2005, the Ministry of Healthdecided to scale up a common national model that incorporated features of each of the pilots. This is aninteresting example of a case of where pilots informed and led to national scale-up (Rusa et al. 2009).Inspired by strong results in neighboring Rwanda, in 2006 Burundi began with pilots of its own supply-side PBI model that includes FP, which it now intends to expand to scale (Busogoro and Beith 2010).With this scheme, Burundi hopes to reduce adolescent pregnancy and increase the contraceptiveprevalence rate, as well as improve maternal and child health. Payments are based partly on quality ofcare delivered, measured by patient and community satisfaction, and partly on use of quantity-relatedincentive payments determined by multiplying fees for specified services by the quantities provided. As inRwanda, public health centers receive monthly fees for a list of services that include FP indicators, whichin Burundi are fees for new FP acceptors and for insertion of IUDs and implants. In addition to fees paidmonthly, quality is assessed quarterly and facilities have the opportunity to earn a bonus of up to anadditional 15 percent of the revenues earned during the quarter determined by how the facility scoreson a quality assessment. Monthly fees and quarterly quality bonuses are earned at the facility level; aportion is used for facility upgrades and the rest is shared among facility staff. In Gitega Province, forexample, FP utilization levels rose from an annual average of around 300 women consultations permonth to just over 800 per month in two years (see Figure 3).21FIGURE 3: INCREASES IN FP UTILIZATION FOLLOWING INTRODUCTION OF A PBI PILOTIN GITEGA PROVINCE, BURUNDIDuring the pilots, health facility quality was assessed quarterly using 154 service-specific compositeindicators. Contracts were established between Provincial Purchasing Agencies and local associationsthat are responsible for validating health services received at the community level, to determinesatisfaction with services used, and to assess the extent of patient/community knowledge. Patients areasked how they were treated by providers, what medicines were prescribed (if any), and what follow-uptook place. Findings from these quarterly community surveys are fed back to the respective health careproviders. Part of the quality payment that facilities receive depends on the results of these surveysconducted by the local associations. Each facility can earn a bonus of up to 15 percent of the totalamount obtained on quantitative results during the same time period. The Ministry of Health intends toraise this bonus to 25 percent during nationwide scale-up.In 2001, Egypt introduced PBI into their family physicians approach to primary health care in the publichealth delivery system in five governorates. Through PBI, facilities receive a financial incentive when theyattain health targets. Two FP targets are established using the following indicators: (i) the percentage offemales of reproductive age (ages 1545) using FP by method, and (ii) the percentage of females ofreproductive age using FP relative to the total number in the catchment area. These indicators arereported monthly to the health district and validated by examining the primary health care logbookmaintained at each facility. This financial incentive is then distributed to the health care staff within thefacility according to a point system that is based on variables such as qualifications, experience, numberof days worked, and efforts made to achieve the indicators in each area. Financial value of each point isdetermined by dividing total payment by total points and each staff member receives this value multipliedby the points they earned. This approach has succeeded in increasing utilization of key services includingFP (El Hayatmy et al. 2010).The opportunity to earn significant performance bonuses (roughly a 250 percent increase in salary) hasdrawn medical specialists into family medicine. However, a significant challenge confronting Egypt is thatit is not clear how to continue to finance this scheme. One of the architects of the scheme now believesthat donor funding should be used to help design and implement PBI schemes, but should not be used topay financial incentives. If this advice had been followed in Egypt, it is likely that the magnitude of theincentive payments would have been lower and financial sustainability more feasible.10With support from USAID, the Health Care Improvement (HCI) Project, and MSH, the Government ofHonduras has introduced PBI that consists of monetary payments to hospitals based on their executionof quality improvement plans. These plans emphasize appropriate and effective implementation of apackage of maternal and newborn services that includes FP, in that payment depends partially on thepercentage of post-obstetric event patients who received information about and were offered FPmethods. The level of funding that a hospital can receive depends on the degree to which each indicatoris met. Targets are set by the central Ministry of Health and each hospital. A small portion of thehospital incentive payment goes directly to members of the quality improvement teams. PBI introductionhas resulted in significant improvements in quality of care indicators. Additionally, other programsoutside of maternal/newborn health have become motivated to adopt quality improvement methods.4.5. VOUCHER SCHEMES ENABLE ACCESS TO A PACKAGE OFSUBSIDIZED SERVICES, REDUCING CLIENT FINANCIALBARRIERS AND INCREASING PROVIDER MOTIVATION TOSERVE THE POORA number of countries are implementing voucher models that either provide at no charge, or sell for asmall fee, books of coupons that enable access to services that include FP. In some settings, voucherholders have a choice of provider that can include public and private options, while in other settingsvoucher holders are assigned to specific providers. Some voucher schemes are run by the government,while others are purely private. Voucher approaches are most often used to target poor andmarginalized populations. We know of voucher schemes in Pakistan and Kenya that include couponsto access FP services. Several other countries (Bangladesh, Cambodia, Myanmar, Nepal, Nicaragua,Uganda) are using some form of vouchers but they either do not include FP or we were not able toverify the specific contents of the subsidized package. Voucher approaches incorporate incentives onboth the demand and supply side.23In Pakistan, Population Services International (PSI) has enhanced the capabilities of the Greenstar socialfranchise and formed another franchise called “GoodLife" to pilot a voucher program in the Dera GhaziKhan district that provides access to a full package of maternal health services from network privateproviders. The package comprises prenatal care, delivery, postnatal care, and FP. Poor pregnant womenwho have previously given birth at home are visited by Lady Health Workers, a form of communityhealth worker, and educated about the benefits of delivering in a health facility. In addition to financialbarriers, there are significant social and cultural barriers to overcome  men and mothers-in-law aredecision makers and community tradition is to deliver at home. It may take multiple visits for thewoman and her family to elect to purchase a voucher book for a small fee that enables access to apackage of services from a GoodLife Provider. When the woman presents for services, the providergives her funds to cover the cost of transportation. After services are provided, providers submit thevouchers to a voucher management agency managed by PSI and receive payment for the servicesprovided; the payment includes fees for each FP counseling session and for provision of modernmethods. This process enables PSI to track actual utilization of services by each voucher recipient byverifying voucher serial numbers against client names (Bashir et al. 2010).In this pilot, 78 percent (1,569) of voucher recipients returned to a contracted provider after deliveringto receive FP counseling. Of these, 32 percent chose not to adopt a FP method, while the others chosemethods as shown in Figure 4.It is important to note that women paying a fee for the voucher book indicates that they wereconvinced of the value of the services and suggests that accessing FP counseling and use of a modernmethod was chosen voluntarily. Interestingly, in Pakistan there is also evidence of a positive spillovereffect as many voucher recipients brought 34 pregnant women from their family or neighborhood forcare at the health facility. This suggests that the voucher scheme may have resulted in changed behaviorof other community members, most striking given that these women had to pay fully for services out ofpocket.A maternal health voucher scheme that includes FP has also been implemented in Kenya, where uptakeof delivery services exceeded expectations but FP utilization fell far short. Voucher distributors arecontracted by a voucher management agency, funded by KFW, to sell subsidized FP vouchers within(currently five) pilot sites. Voucher distributors receive a monthly salary and are trained in how to applya standardized poverty assessment tool, adapted by Marie Stopes International for the Kenya context, tograde potential clients on criteria including housing, access to health sources, water sources andsanitation, daily income, and number of meals per day. Voucher distributors must also conduct homevisits to verify the poverty grading tool responses. Sometimes informal arrangements are made betweenthe distributors and the clients if clients cannot pay the full voucher fee upfront. For example, they canarrange to pay the distributor in installments. Voucher holders provide the purchased vouchers to theirpreferred accredited service provider to receive the services linked to the particular type of voucher.One lesson from the Kenya experience is that vouchers reduce financial barriers to accessing FPservices, but they do not alone address other determinants of the choice to use FP. Other reasonsinhibiting use of FP in Kenya are concerns about safety, religious prohibition, personal opposition, and adesired family size of many children. Identifying outlets for FP commodities and access are not majorissues for any age group. This highlights the need to take into account local attitudes towards FP and toconsider developing appropriate marketing and educational outreach components when designing avoluntary FP PBI intervention (Bellows et al. 2009). The next phase of this pilot intends to address thesecomplementary components.PBI can also be used to motivate community health workers. These workers play an important role inidentifying pregnant women, in counseling women, families, and their communities, and in recognizingwhere FP demand is unmet. Examples of this include both India and the Philippines, where communityhealth workers receive financial incentives dependent on completion of a package of services. In bothcases, payment to the workers is accompanied by demand-side payments to overcome financial andsocial obstacles poor women face.In India, the government-supported Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) program provides PBI to individualfemale village-level community health workers, called Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHA), whoserve as a liaison between the community and government health systems. ASHAs are responsible forimplementation of a full package of care composed of a number of activities that assist a woman throughpregnancy and delivery and that are important to both the woman and the newborn's health directly25following birth. Payment to ASHAs from the JSY is conditional on their completing all of these activities,which includes FP counseling. The JSY program also provides demand-side payments to women, whichare linked to facility-based delivery, not specifically to FP.11 Eligibility criteria differ by state.12 In what arecalled “low-performing states" all pregnant women of any caste, age, or income group who deliver in agovernment or accredited private health facility qualify for the JSY program and receive the financialincentive. In “high performing states" all pregnant women who are members of scheduled caste/scheduletribe communities and pregnant women who are below the poverty line and older than 19 years qualifyfor the program.In addition, the National Rural Health Mission in India provides payments to individuals who choosesterilization, to the community health worker who accompanies them, and to the service provider whoperforms the sterilization services (Government of India 2007). In low-performing states, below povertyline women who receive tubectomies receive 600 rupees, below poverty line men receive 1100 rupeesfor vasectomies, and ASHAs receive 150-200 rupees when they accompany women for tubectomies andmen for vasectomies. These fees are intended to cover the opportunity costs of lost wages and travel. Inaddition to fees paid to ASHAs and individuals, there are fees for the service providers who providesterilization services.The Philippines is currently piloting a performance-based payment scheme with the goal of supportingfacility-based childbirth and increasing the role of skilled attendance at delivery among disadvantagedwomen. FP is included as part of the package of maternal health services, but it is not explicitlyrewarded. As in India, the scheme includes both supply- and demand-side payments. On the supply side,payment goes to Women's Health Teams (WHTs), which are composed of a rural health unit midwife,one barangay health worker,13 and one traditional birth attendant. On the demand side, womendelivering in an appropriate health facility also receive a payment to offset childbirth-related expenses,such as transportation to reach the facility, and medicines, medical supplies, and food required duringthe stay. Funded through the Department of Health and Municipal Local Government Units, this schemeis designed to encourage WHTs to track and counsel all women within their catchment area and toencourage pregnant women to have facility-based deliveries. Like the India JSY program's ASHAs, WHTsare responsible for implementing a full package of care. However, while FP is part of this package(WHTs organize outreach activities for FP and provide counseling), FP itself is not explicitly incentivized,as both supply- and demand-side payments are tied only to facility-based delivery.CCT programs are large-scale social protection programs that link income transfers to poor householdsif specified conditions are met, usually related to utilization of health, education, and nutrition services.Since 1997, seven countries in Latin America and the Caribbean (Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador,11 Acceptors of sterilization and IUD insertion in public and private accredited health facilities receive payments from theNational Rural Health Mission meant to compensate for lost wages. ASHAs who refer people receive fees and thefacilities receive payments.12 The government of India has divided states into two categories based on rates of institutional delivery. The 10 stateswith the lowest rates of institutional delivery are classified as “low-performing states"; they are Assam, Bihar, Chattisgarh,Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Uttaranchal, and Jammu and Kashmir. The remaining 18states are “high-performing states"; they are Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, HimachalPradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Punjab, Sikkim, Tamil Nadu, Tripura,and West Bengal.13 Barangay health workers are individuals who have undergone training programs under any accredited governmental ornongovernmental organization program and who provide primarily health care services in their community after havingbeen accredited to function as such by the local health board in accordance with the guidelines promulgated by thePhilippines Department of Health.Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, Nicaragua) have implemented and evaluated CCT programs withhealth and nutrition components (Glassman et al. 2009). Health and nutrition components of CCTs aimto stimulate demand for health services by transferring cash to mothers conditional on their seekingservices for themselves and their children at health clinics and attending health education talks thatcover FP, among other topics. CCTs may influence use of FP by improving understanding of FP benefitsthrough health education talks, increasing access to FP commodities by incentivizing more frequentcontact with the formal service delivery system, and by intensifying the focus on investing in theirchildren's health and education.CCTs may also have the perverse effect of stimulating an increase in fertility if cash transfers are linkedto family size or numbers of children in school. Unintended effects of the CCT program in Hondurasmay have contributed to a 24 percent increase in fertility  a possible result of providing incometransfers that vary with the number of children and pregnant women in a household (Stecklov et al.2006). This effect was not observed in Mexico and Nicaragua, where income transfers do not varywith family size. CCTs in Mexico appear to have delayed the onset of premarital sex, age of marriage,and age at first and second birth (Gulemetova-Swan 2009).27As health programs throughout the developing world incorporate demand- and supply-side PBI, there isa real danger that voluntary FP will be neglected if not included. Progress in voluntary FP might stall ordecline if FP is left out and with it the missed opportunity to contribute to broader development goals.By building on ways voluntary FP has been included in developing-country PBI approaches, identifyingchallenges and gaps, and contributing to a future agenda to fill these gaps, FP can be incorporated inways that are effective as well as responsible and can protect voluntary choice and be in compliance withUSAID FP requirements. The cases described in this paper can inform those operating in the USG-funded context as well as others who value voluntarism about relevant PBI options. There is someevidence that some countries are choosing not to include FP at least partially due to concerns about theTiahrt Amendment; as one PBI survey respondent shared, “the indicators for this scheme have not beendesigned yet. However, the indicators will not target a number of family planning acceptors due to Tiahrtamendment concerns." We wish to reassure program designers and implementers that voluntary FP canbe included in PBI programs in ways that comply with U.S. FP requirements.There is a need, however, to develop indicators of quality, in addition to the quantity measures that arein current use. The majority of FP indicators currently included in developing-country PBI programsfocus on quantities of commodities or services delivered rather than quality of counseling or clinicalcare. They reward availability of needed inputs (e.g., availability of commodities, availability of trainedstaff) or numbers of FP services delivered (e.g., new acceptors). Few programs reward provision ofquality counseling or FP services, partly because quality is harder to specify, measure, and verify than isquantity. This challenge is not unique to FP, as early PBI programs usually begin by rewarding the “lowhanging fruit" of relatively simple to measure, countable services that can be reported through existinginformation systems.As donors embrace the principles of country-led health plans and this is complemented by increasedaccountability for results, linking payment to performance is likely to increase in prominence. We maysee more PBA, as donors condition payment to countries on achieved results. We may also see anincrease in national to sub-national PBI as governments exercise their influence through conditionsattached to intergovernmental fiscal transfers. At the national and sub-national levels, rewardingpopulation coverage of voluntary FP services as well as their quality is consistent with U.S. FPrequirements.Because true impact occurs at the interface between users and service providers, any incentiveapproach has to strengthen the systems needed to reach clients and ensure delivery of voluntary, qualityFP counseling and services. Rewarding population-based targets is consistent with U.S. FP requirementsif the level being rewarded is a facility or team, as long as facilities have more than one person on staff.Payment for each service is acceptable at the facility/team or individual provider level, as long aspayments are reasonable and in line with payments for other services. FP users can receive payments tooffset transportation costs to overcome this often significant barrier to access. Rewards for qualitycounseling and service delivery, if feasible metrics are developed, can be used at each level.In settings with service delivery NGOs and private providers, contracts can incorporate conditions thatrequire achievement of specified results, and payment can be linked to this achievement. This is true inweak state settings as well as stable contexts. Governments, donors, and social insurance entities canincorporate PBI for voluntary FP counseling and services into the payment terms with NGOs, FBOs, and29private providers. Payment can reward attainment of population coverage or pay for each FP servicedelivered, provided that the per service payment is in line with payments for other services. Rewardingquality FP counseling and service provision is a priority with private providers as discussed above. Insome settings, voucher schemes may help create a “market" for providing FP counseling and services,increasing both supply of quality services and demand. By reducing prices paid by the poor andcomplementing these subsidized prices with top ups that pay providers competitive fees, financial accessbarriers for poor households can be partially overcome and willingness to serve the poor can increase.When users pay even small fees to purchase vouchers, it is an indication of voluntary choice. Rewardingavailability of modern methods may be a strong indicator during the early stages of a PBI scheme,especially in low-resource environments. However, this indicator appears to respond quickly and mayneed to be replaced with measures of counseling, use, or quality as systems develop and commoditiesbecome more reliably available. Once information systems are in place to report on counseling andacceptance of methods, countries are able to incorporate measures of quantity into performanceincentive programs. The coming challenge is to develop measures of quality counseling and qualityservice provision that can be measured and validated in a routine and cost-effective way to be able tolink to performance payments.To support development of PBI approaches that incorporate voluntary FP, countries may requesttechnical assistance to help structure the terms of payment agreements; to define rewardedperformance measures; to establish the administrative functions needed to contract, monitor, verify, andpay; and to train recipients of PBI arrangements to understand new rules and how to effectively respondto them to achieve results. Countries may also appreciate help with strategies to consult withstakeholders during the design phase to assess what will work and refine the approach. Input to developadvocacy strategies to identify challenges and build support for a feasible PBI approach may also beappreciated.Paying for FP results has potential to contribute to reducing unwanted and mistimed pregnancies and, bydoing so, contribute to reducing maternal and newborn mortality. For countries already implementingPBI, including voluntary FP in the package of rewarded services will help to motivate providers tocounsel couples about the benefits of FP and the choices available and will help to ensure that voluntaryFP is not neglected. This paper describes a number of approaches that can be considered thatincorporate FP into PBI schemes responsibly and in accordance with U.S. FP requirements. As PBI isevolving and learning and innovation is a dynamic process, we can expect to continue to learn abouteffective approaches to incorporate voluntary FP.ANNEX: EXPANDING ACCESS TO FPAND PROTECTING INFORMEDCHOICE IN THE UNITED STATESWe have chosen to highlight the U.S. experience with FP to share one example of how the tensionbetween using payments to reward providers for the provision of services that are adopted voluntarilyand safeguarding the voluntarism of clients' adoption of the service can be minimized. In addition topresenting an opportunity for reproductive control, prevention of health and social consequences ofmistimed or unwanted pregnancies, and prevention of the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, a FPvisit can also serve as a woman's entry into the health system (Institute of Medicine [IOM] 2009). Theseopportunities are joined with unique challenges in delivering FP as a health service.Despite being one of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) top-10 great publichealth achievements during the 20th century (see Figure A-1), FP was not always available to thoseseeking to have smaller families or longer birth intervals (CDC April 1999). To meet the rising demandfor contraception, the U.S. Congress passed several laws designed to expand access to FP. Title X(“Title Ten") of the Public Health Service Act of 1970 authorized the Department of Health and HumanService's Office of Family Planning to give grants to public and nonprofit entities to establish and operateFP clinics, train service providers, conduct research, and engage in community outreach (IOM 2009) Theprogram is hereafter referred to as the Title X program. The state/federal Medicaid program wasamended in 1972 to require states to cover FP services. To incentivize states to expand these servicesfurther, the federal government has paid for a larger proportion of FP services than it does other healthservices on average since 1966.14 Overall, the late 20th century was characterized by initiatives to allowpatients and their physicians to access FP, as well as generate more demand for FP through educationand outreach.Contemporary views on FP are that individuals have the right to practice FP if desired, but the practicemust be voluntary and providers must ensure informed consent. In the past, there have been cases inthe United States where today's standards for voluntarism in FP programs have not been upheld. Insome cases, FP was forced on non-consenting women by powerful institutions (Schoen 2005). As aresponse to allegations of forced sterilizations, state legislatures have created laws and regulatoryagencies to ensure that voluntarism is unequivocally protected.14 The Federal Medical Assistance Percentages (FMAPs) are percentages of the total cost of a Medicaid health service thatthe federal government pays. The remainder is paid by the state in which the recipient resides. Generally, FMAPs are atleast 50 percent and vary by state depending on the state's per capita income relative to the national average. FP enjoys aspecial status among covered services. The federal government pays 90 percent of services and supplies for Medicaidbeneficiaries in all states, as per Section 1903 [42 U.S.C. 1396b] of the Social Security Act, amended in 1965.31PBI, called Pay for Performance (P4P) in the U.S. context, started in the United States in the 1980s, inprivate health care. More recently, P4P programs have expanded into public provision of health care.15Performance measures have been designed, critiqued, and amended through the participation of a richarray of experts and stakeholders. The U.S. health system is different from those of low- and middle-income countries, with its mix of private and public payers (such as Medicare and Medicaid), private andpublic providers, and a dizzying mix of payment mechanisms, incentives, and initiatives to control costsand improve quality. This diversity contains important lessons for other contexts; however, thisincentive “soup" is murkier in the United States than in most developing-country contexts, making thepotential impact of a P4P scheme in a developing country potentially even more powerful.We found no evidence of direct use of P4P to improve FP procurement and delivery in the UnitedStates. This may reflect an absence of need to incentivize providers to offer FP services. The P4Pmovement entered health care practice long after the advent of successful nationwide federally fundedFP programs. Most counties in the United States now have at least one provider offering comprehensiveFP services regardless of the patient's ability to pay (Frost et al. 2004). This widespread availability mayhave been a factor in allowing Congress to exempt FP from Medicaid managed care programs asMedicaid moved away from fee-for-service in the 1990s (Lindberg et al. 2006).Characteristics of American society fostered growth in demand for contraception and other FP servicesin the 20th century and eventually contributed to changes in the way health care was delivered in theUnited States. Civil society groups and women's rights advocates helped to spread awareness of FP andSome large P4P programs currently operating in the private sector include The Leapfrog Group's Hospital RewardsProgram (www.leapfroggroup.org), Bridges to Excellence programs and PROMETHEUS payment schemes(http://bridgestoexcellence.org), and Integrated Healthcare Association's PBI program in California(http://www.iha.org/pay_performance.html). The USG has also started PBI programs in the public health sector throughThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid's Premier Hospital Quality Incentive Demonstration and Physician GroupPractice Demonstration (www.cms.hhs.gov).empower women to demand reproductive rights. Patient demand for FP was high and the health systemhad to expand to meet that demand. Additionally, providers became early advocates of FP for theirpatients. Fee-for-service provider reimbursement encouraged delivery of high quantities of healthservices, thus provider motivation was not a large issue in the United States, unlike in poorer countrieswith salaried physicians. Availability of funding, good infrastructure, and relatively low entry barriers tothe private health care sector allowed the health care system to expand and for Medicaid and the TitleX program to be implemented nationwide.While developing country contexts differ, popular and political recognition of the importance of FPwarranted the creation of these U.S.-based domestic programs for many of the same reasons FP meritsconsideration in P4P programs abroad. Aside from provider motivation and patient demand, there areissues that seem to transcend national income levels and populations. Medicaid and the Title X programwere created to expand access to FP to vulnerable populations such as low-income people. Theseprograms were intended to address health care equity, protect voluntarism and informed choice, andbalance competing forces.FP indicators that have been used in domestic programs have been designed with those goals in mind,and may be helpful in guiding designs for FP indicators in P4P programs in those settings. Box A-1contains a list of indicators currently used to evaluate the Title X program and new ones proposed bythe IOM that further emphasize quality of services and patient-centered care (see IOM 2009).Some aspects of the Title X program in the United States have elicited discussion that may be relevantin P4P programs that include FP indicators. The first discussion centers around balancing informedchoice with effectiveness and efficiency. To protect informed choice, providers who receive fundingfrom the program must discuss the entire range of FP options with new patients. While it is thoughtthat many providers and commentators believe an emphasis on education and counseling is importantfor protecting informed choice and contributes to more satisfied patients (Gold 2008), the IOM offersthat excessive information could interfere with the patient's retention of knowledge and iscounterproductive when patients come in for a visit with a method preference (IOM 2009). These twodemands can compete and must be balanced when designing P4P indicators that protect informedchoice.The second discussion surrounds balancing opportunities to provide comprehensive care with the goalof attracting as many patients as possible. Health-seeking behavior may be reinforced if patients feel thatthey can seek any service unconditionally. If women visit a health center to obtain contraception, it istempting to take advantage of the woman's presence by providing her other health services. Thewoman's visit for FP may be her only visit to a health center. However, women may be intimidated byother tests, shots, or services and may choose not to visit the health center for FP purposes if sheknows that obtaining other services are preconditions. Potential patients of Title X clinics reportedlyavoided a visit when the Title X program required that all new patients receive a Pap smear at their firstvisit. To ensure that the clinics could attract as many women as possible, the program modified thisprovision by allowing the woman six months after her first visit to receive a Pap smear (IOM 2009).While public health experts wanted as many women as possible to be screened for cervical cancer,provision of contraception may have been compromised as an unintended consequence.33Socioeconomic characteristicsClient knowledge, intendedness, visit agenda*Number of clientsFundingProgram requirementsRatio of staffing to patient encountersa.

For example, theMedicaid program tried to balance convenience and maximum services provided with attention tovoluntarism. However, it is often possible for physicians to perform sterilization at the time of awoman's delivery and while many women ask for this service voluntarily, there is potential for abusegiven that the physician is in a position of power. After 1978, the Medicaid program no longerreimbursed physicians for sterilizations performed at the time of delivery; instead, women must havegiven informed consent 30 days prior to the service in most cases (Kaiser Family Foundation 2005).Some critics argue that this law is harmful to public health because some women never return for theservice, but others argue it is necessary to protect voluntarism.35Bashir, Hamid, Sarfaraz Kazmi, Rena Eichler, Alix Beith, and Ellie Brown.
