I'd love to see it in the Congressional Record. It should blow if not change a few minds.Quite honestly, your vote to disallow a U.S. allocation to the United Nations Population Fund shows your utter lack of discernment, your ignorance about the function of UNFPA, and your willingness to believe the lies of Chris Smith over the consensus in the world that women's health, education, and human rights are at the core of any chance in the future for people, the planet and peace. (Nothing like starting with a bang!)Did you know that UNFPA is the humanitarian agency of the United Nations to which the greatest number of countries contribute? All of our allies and long time "friends" contribute. They are quite frankly baffled and appalled by your short sighted politically motivated mean spiritedness.Did you know that UNFPA does not participate in abortion but only offers the family planning that all of us take for granted? Have you ever used family planning? Yeah, I thought so.As co-founder of 34 Million Friends of UNFPA, I visited a UNFPA clinic in Senegal. A 22 year old woman had just given birth to her fourth baby. She and the baby were anemic. So UNFPA was going to counsel her and her husband about the possible use of contraception. Is that OK with you?Do something for me. Watch an 80 second video at www.empty-handed [http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?llr=aajwdndab&et=1104667028108&s=811&e=001Q771aBrSO6nxbnj2IQlL4EpHc6enGufwFZM5zGnIYLLtCM_ZBrb4vMjxbWSjXjWEQf2z-UlrkQdXEb7KK55kjuUs6unDrPhiYl_UQ8N7yY53nIGokmusvA==] .org. Family planning i.e. contraception is a great gift of the 20th and 21st centuries. It saves women's and children's lives and makes a huge, I mean HUGE, contribution to maternal health. UNFPA is the largest supplier of family planning commodities in the world.I'm going to keep you busy. Read a little book: "I Am Nujood Age 10 and Divorced." I actually sent a copy to Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen. Borrow hers. For all the truly courageous Nujoods of the world there are thousands of children and adolescents girls who languish in early forced marriages. If you are a woman, go back to when you were 13 and imagine the terror of your adult age new husband approaching the marriage bed. UNFPA has put out a heart-rending video: Too Brief a Child, Voices of Married Adolescents.Child marriage, female genital mutilation with the resultant hard scar tissue, and the unavailability of C-sections are three basic causes of obstetric fistula. In the 19th century, there used to be a fistula hospital where the Waldorf Astoria hotel now stands. Thanks to 34 Million Friends of UNFPA, the Point G hospital in Bamako, Mali has an additional operating room for fistula. At least a few Mali women no longer walk around with urine and/or feces dripping on their feet!And UNFPA trains doctors in fistula surgery techniques and in rural areas where country sponsored services are not available, UNFPA-trained doctors are available 24/7 for emergency obstetric care. Has anyone in your family ever needed a C-section?And about FGM, well, UNFPA along with religious, tribal, and political leaders the world over are persuading whole villages to abandon the practice which causes such long term harm to so many girls and women. Is anything wrong with that?Have you ever heard of the Millennium Development Goals? Adopted in 2000 at the United Nations, they are a blueprint for an acceptable future. Number 4 deals with child mortality. About 9 million kids under 5 die every year from myriad causes, but forty percent of these 9 million die in their first month. The main reason is that their mothers were absolutely not healthy enough for a full term normal pregnancy. Their little 3 pound babies come onto the earth and then just fade away. Take care of mothers!Number 5 of the MDGs states simply "Improve Maternal Health". That's what UNFPA  does. It improves maternal health. It prevents maternal mortality, urges young people to avoid risky sexual behavior, offers the family planning which prevents millions of abortions, and tries to stem the tide of gender based violence. What is wrong with you!Let's talk some more about abortion. Of the 200 million pregnancies in the world every year, twenty percent end in abortion. That's 40 million! Of those, half are legal, therefore safe. And yet, where there are laws against abortion, twenty million women use horrific means to have a self-induced abortion or seek out flim flam abortion providers. These illegal abortions cause tens of thousands of deaths and about 5 million cases every year of injuries, hemorrhages, and infections necessitating post abortion care. When have laws against abortion ever worked? Never! And yet self righteous, and in many cases hypocritical politicians like yourselves keep trying. If the men among you could become pregnant, they would support access to family planning and safe abortion to the hilt!I'll bet a lot of you voted to defund Planned Parenthood this week. I wrote the following letter to three newspapers in my area concerning my Congressman Jerry Lewis who voted for H.R. 217."Our Congressman Jerry Lewis voted with the majority of the House of Representatives for H.R. 217 which bans all funds to Planned Parenthood. If Planned Parenthood is defunded by our government this will mean more abortions, higher federal health care costs, and a swelling of welfare rolls. Planned Parenthood with its family planning services prevents more abortions than all the "pro-life" preachers and politicians combined. It spends three percent of its budget (none of it from taxes) on its abortion services.I graduated from San Diego High School in 1958. The "knocked up" girls went to Tijuana. Is that what we want? Thank goodness that today, for whatever reason, women and girls of limited financial capabilities can access basic health services such as family planning, pap smears, breast exams and pre-natal care through Planned Parenthood. And for whatever reason, they can access a legal therefore safe abortion and get on with their lives. I have lost all respect for Congressman Lewis."You see, your votes against Planned Parenthood and against UNFPA are not attacks on these organizations so much as they are attacks on women, most of whom don't have financial means and out there in the world are totally bereft, who need reproductive health services. That is despicable. There is no other word for it.So grow up. You really are acting like children. In his heart of hearts Jerry Lewis knows that he just followed the party line, the path of least resistance. What a coward!Well, I hope I have blown a few minds if not changed them. Come on you guys. Motherhood is the most joyous, life affirming experience one can have. Help make it that way for all women everywhere.From http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rep-carolyn-maloney/acts-of-outrage-indiffere_b_827574.html [http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?llr=aajwdndab&et=1104667028108&s=811&e=001Q771aBrSO6kdTOA2tKlbT87zdoJU17OFZ25aNTL9VmKlmfM5P3P3RcquFZG_8mSpw3cojMYOAxhtlE9Dhls1ovjVNbjW9Ulnvr6c2-068QDN41JNMYneewzYZV1qMVDAnZ2k8K8sxwCoWW0Se6dWc9ph9OwIqDkdWKdQoaHAcgP6DOSjAkyIjN1xIKPZOWKDxjQwYbMQ-Kc=]BLOG: Acts of Outrage, Indifference and ArroganceSource: Huffington Post Author: Rep. Carolyn MaloneyThe current Republican attack on women's personal liberties, our access to reproductive health services and our right to lifesaving medical care is stunning in its scope, appalling in its indifference, and outrageous in its arrogance. Their proposals go way beyond anything in current law, significantly reducing access to family planning services and making abortion uninsurable. For years, anti-choice advocates succeeded in whittling away at reproductive freedoms, but the current three-pronged attack goes far beyond anything in existing law and is dangerous beyond measure.First, there is HR 358, which would allow medical providers to decline to treat a woman whose life is at risk if doctors believe the treatment might harm her fetus. Furthermore, if a woman's condition is so serious that she needs to be hospitalized, the GOP proposal would permit the hospital to decline to perform a life-saving abortion or to transfer her to another facility that will. Some critics are understandably calling this bill the "Let Women Die Act."As indifferent to the lives of women as HR 358 is, it is just one part of a package. HR 3, the "No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act," makes it highly unlikely that any insurance company would write a policy that covers abortions. Under this bill no policy will be eligible for a tax deduction or tax credit if it covers abortion. Women would also be prohibited from using pre-tax dollars in their flexible spending plans to pay for abortions. There is no exemption to preserve the woman's health. In its overreach and arrogance, this bill would not just deny abortion coverage to poor women who get their health care through government programs like Medicaid, it would deny such critical care even to those women who are paying thousands of dollars of their own money for private insurance, either directly or through their employer.In a third and particularly pernicious attack, the GOP is working to deny all Title X family planning funding to Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers. The GOP's continuing resolution to fund the government through the end of this year, which the Republican-controlled House passed last week without a single Democratic vote, targeted Planned Parenthood and successfully defunded the lifesaving organization.Planned Parenthood is the nation's largest provider of family planning services, and for roughly 60 percent of their patients, they serve as primary care physicians. According to the 2008-2009 Annual Report for Planned Parenthood [http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?llr=aajwdndab&et=1104667028108&s=811&e=001Q771aBrSO6lV1yhfH3dC631vOUJcMDQsThyCABKOQJF9p29XYJqF-vDfCEi3AvqJ_A7-g5BBtc1mt4yNoYeQYOCbdi-UtFlmWs_bD0ScXGsAp6_TD--Y6vYHRXG9bDwkN7F-RWNHeYZubflLIFSDzYeNTtD-E9ToP3rLLbBbus0=], 90 percent of the health care they provide is designed to prevent conception, reduce the incidence of sexually-transmitted diseases (STD) through testing and treatment, and to prevent cervical and other cancers through lifesaving screenings, including one million pap tests, 830,000 breast examinations and 4 million STD tests. The GOP's anti-woman provisions would make it impossible for poor women to receive such services at providers such as Planned Parenthood, leaving many women with nowhere else to turn.Even as they complain about "the government's intrusion into people's lives", the far-right forces of reaction are using their newfound power, not to grow the economy, but to invade even the most personal areas of women's private lives, coming between her and her doctor, and dictating her decisions in private family matters.Not one of these Republican proposals would create a single job, decrease the deficit, expand the economy, increase our freedom or insure our liberty. These proposals are not merely anti-choice -- they are also anti-health and anti-woman.Thanks to Don Collins for this OpEd by Dick Scaife in the Pittsburgh Tribune Review.

Yet I respected her dedication to making health-care and birth-control services available to all Americans, especially to those with low incomes, no insurance and no other recourse to medical services.And I admired her fearless, relentless readiness to stand up for what she believed, despite decades of angry, mean-spirited, often hypocritical attacks on her ideas and her character.So I am aggravated by the continuing attacks on Sanger and her primary legacy, the Planned Parenthood network that still serves so many Americans today.Now the Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives -- urged on by conservatives opposed to abortion -- has voted to defund Planned Parenthood.On this issue, Republicans and conservatives are dead wrong.Abortions are a minor aspect of Planned Parenthood's mission to provide reproductive health care, education and other services to Americans, regardless of income.More than 90 percent of its work focuses on preventing unintended pregnancies that almost inevitably lead to unwanted, neglected and abused children.In Pittsburgh and across America, Planned Parenthood offices help people to make better decisions about whether to have children. They help to arrange adoptions for women or couples unable to raise a child but unwilling to end a pregnancy.Most of their clients are poor Americans who cannot afford birth-control measures that cost as much as $1,500 a month.Of the 10,000 to 12,000 people who use local Planned Parenthood services, about 20 percent are teenagers, half are ages 20 to 30 and the rest over 30.Of course, no one wants teenagers to get pregnant. Yet far too many do -- and they need reliable, honest advice about what to do next. For many of them, Planned Parenthood is the only reliable source of that advice. For many others, Planned Parenthood is the only safe, reliable source of counseling to avoid getting pregnant in the first place.If not for Margaret Sanger's vision and bravery, many poor Americans would have no place to turn for birth-control measures and counseling or for other health care services.To take that away makes no sense.Dick Scaife is chairman of Trib Total Media, parent company of the Tribune-Review.Read more: Don't defund Planned Parenthood - Pittsburgh Tribune-Review [http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?llr=aajwdndab&et=1104667028108&s=811&e=001Q771aBrSO6kOl2r4XC1nhGTq8BJDtjTTyjt64y33KqX9MWXdpmr9Ve3Bz0vSlSeeksODD1kcxmZJgZRqorjJa2cBRl6jldlaPOnr8BJ7We7jtvVYuLHLK4owWXa6eBOIcpAblPUCW0fh7bo2qKTOI6G-DDQsVb1obB6TBvdeTvkWMQCP40i01erTnzMxG8gKf5H2pIXvtD8=]http://pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/opinion/print_724735.html#ixzz1FOQ5RlR2 [http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?llr=aajwdndab&et=1104667028108&s=811&e=001Q771aBrSO6kOl2r4XC1nhGTq8BJDtjTTyjt64y33KqX9MWXdpmr9Ve3Bz0vSlSeeksODD1kcxmZJgZRqorjJa2cBRl6jldlaPOnr8BJ7We7jtvVYuLHLK4owWXa6eBOIcpAblPUCW0fh7bo2qKTOI6G-DDQsVb1obB6TBvdeTvkWMQCP40i01erTnzMxG8gKf5H2pIXvtD8=]Thanks to Bob Walker for this OpEd by Jonathan Porritt.

Sign up to the Population Institute's "Million for a Billion" campaign petition on www.millionforabillion.com [http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?llr=aajwdndab&et=1104667028108&s=811&e=001Q771aBrSO6kOl2r4XC1nhCzlyONY4RuA-BqKPUJV7mORYmHcE2jYdoDDqJZXeWulwJtyrqvpyhZH6dJ0EJsHS0VkHLWdIQmJ2mrv4y004wsAobi406OKXKu57ofxhIQP]. Its aim couldn't be simpler: recruit a million people to help persuade world leaders to boost the total level of international support for family planning assistance by at least $1 billion a year. Do this against a backdrop where 215 million women in the world today still do not have access to family planning services, or to the right to decide for themselves the number of children they have or when to have them; where there are 75 million unintended pregnancies every year; and where 20 million women die every year resorting to unsafe abortions. International funding for family planning support has not only shrunk dramatically in terms of the total funds available (family planning represented 55% of the total primary fund for population assistance back in 1995, but in 2008 it accounted for a mere 6% - largely because of the huge increases in funding from HIV/AIDS), but remained far below the minimum targets agreed by governments. And if you're wondering why you should bother about this, let me briefly tell you the tale of two recent reports. The first is the blockbuster report from the UK Government's Office for Science on "The Future of Food and Farming" - the purpose of which is to "identify the decisions that policymakers need to make today, and in the years ahead, to ensure that a global population rising to 9 billion or more can be fed sustainably and equitably". It's a strong report. Very good on some aspects of food security (such as the importance of eliminating food waste and the need for governments to start putting a lot more money into both R&D and support for farmers in developing and emerging economies), very weak on others (for instance, on the need to balance global supply chains with local self-reliance), and predictably pro-GM in an embarrassingly knee-jerk kind of way. But its unforgivable failure lies in its abject inability to address population issues - despite the reference to the 9 billion above. Whilst it eloquently emphasises the role that women play around the world, stressing the importance of "promoting the agency of women in ways that will accelerate hunger reduction", it has nothing to say about a woman's right to manage her own fertility - including the timing, number and spacing of children. Nothing to say about a woman's right to guaranteed access to a choice of contraception, or to be able to rely on improved reproductive healthcare. The report joins up practically every other aspect of food security - but its authors were just too cowardly to address this one. By contrast, the latest Worldwatch Report on "Population, Climate Change and Women's Lives" (Report 183, www.worldwatch.org [http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?llr=aajwdndab&et=1104667028108&s=811&e=001Q771aBrSO6kbxU-MGsnMinIH7CRqmFn6LWaKxxzSMFkBK2_gFCnNuAnFwMNuyK17ffZ6qIz_8TIIxsRR7GKSo0P77155M3d43OulaPIz1YXmMy3bKUPqIA==]) is one of the best documents I've ever read explaining the linkages between climate change, population and women's rights. The overall tone is set early on: "In crafting policies, population change should be viewed as one element of the historic effort to bring women into equal standing with men. Women and children in poverty are among the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, despite their disproportionately low contribution to the problem. Removing the obstacles that hold back more than 3 billion potential agents of change - women and girls - is both pragmatic and necessary." From that point on, the report then navigates its way within enormous skill through the shoals of controversy that surrounds climate change policy from a population-driven perspective. It gently rebukes those who continue to argue (regardless of the wealth of available evidence) that addressing the needs of the 215 million women without access to contraception has nothing to do with effective policy-making on climate change, and by taking a rights-based perspective all the way through ("the only acceptable way to slow global population growth is as an outcome of improving the well-being of women worldwide"), it lays to rest once and for all those hoary old myths about post-Imperial plots to keep poor countries (and poor women) in their place. It's so good I could give you quotes from practically every page. But read it for yourself. And then ask yourself if there is one single, teensy-weensy residual reason not to sign up to the "Million for a Billion" petition. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
