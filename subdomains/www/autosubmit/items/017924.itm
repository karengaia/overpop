body^In Vietnam, the number of family members was reduced to 4.61 in 1999 from 5.22 in 1979 and this trend is believed to continue as the country increases industrial development. 

Regional family sizes differ depending on developmental level. The Red River Delta region has the lowest family size with an average of 4.1 and the northwestern mountainous region, with over 5 members to a family, represented the highest. 

Smaller-sized families provide more female equality and better care for children, but they pose challenges to family traditions such as taking care of the elderly and the establishment of good child characteristics. Up to 30% of surveyed families in Hanoi said they have not had time to teach their children beneficial characteristics. 

The trend that married children live apart from parents has driven old people into loneliness and economic difficulties, especially in rural communities. Due to the opening of the economy, all Vietnamese families face drug addiction, prostitution and street children. 

To help families cope social organisations have worked together to increase public awareness on family roles and responsibilities. 

Vietnam Family day is celebrated every June 28 with various activities to raise public awareness against social evils involving the family.

fullbody^Section: Regional News - Population censuses have showed that there is a rising trend towards small families in Vietnam, a country rated by ESCAP as Southeast Asia's fastest-growing economy in 2006.

General censuses have showed that regional family sizes differ depending on an areas developmental level. The Red River Delta region has the lowest family size with an average of 4.1 people in a family and the northwestern mountainous region, with over five members to a family, represented the highest family size in the nation. 

Smaller-sized families provide advantages, such as more female equality and better care for children, but they also pose challenges to family traditions such as taking care of the elderly and the establishment of good child characteristics. Up to 30 percent of surveyed families in Hanoi said they have not had time to teach their children beneficial characteristics. 

The trend that married children live apart from parents has driven old people into a danger of loneliness and economic difficulties, especially in rural communities where social insurances for the elderly are not commonplace. 

Due to the opening of the economy, all Vietnamese families face vulnerabilities to social evils and problems such as drug addiction, prostitution and street children. 

To help families cope with these problems, agencies and social organisations have worked together to increase public awareness on family roles and responsibilities to build a model of civilised and sustainable families. Vietnam Family day was also set up in 2001 for this purpose. 

Vietnam Family day is celebrated every June 28 with various activities to raise public awareness against social evils involving the family. ï¿½ VNA

comment^Karen Gaia says: 4.1 is still a very large number - population will double in just a few years!! Grown children are forced off of the agricultural lands of their parents because there is not enough land to sustain the growing population. This results in splitting families into nuclear units.
