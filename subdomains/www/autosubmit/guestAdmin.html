<ol>
<b><li>Changes:</b> If changes to an article need to be made, follow the <a
href=#changearticle>instructions below</a>.</li><p>

<b><li>Summarized:</b> For many of the articles, you will need to go to
<A target=_blank HREF="
http://www.population-awareness.net/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/popaware/article.pl?display_section%%%Suggested_suggestedItem%
">Suggested/Summarized Articles</a> and check for 'Summarized' articles.
There should be a gray button at the end of the article. Click on that and
follow the <a href=#changearticle>instructions below</a> to proof-read,
tidy-up, and advance the article to its next location - the News Digest
(preliminary to putting it on the Public page). After you have processed
all of the articles in 'Summarized', proceed to the next step.
</li><p>

<b><li>Preliminary review:</b> Check out pages before sending them to the
Public Page. Go to <a href=#important links>'important links'</a>. Look at
the News Digest page and see if both top and bottom of page are there and
no 'Transfer Interrupted' or anything else weird in the middle. If they
are, simply refresh the link. The graphics will be missing - they don't
generate on the fly. Also briefly look at each of the Headline Links below(a few seconds
after each page comes up). If you get some strange message, try the link again.
This will generate the page again and likely get rid of most of the problems.

<b><li>Advance</b> - <a href="

l?move2">Click here (once only)</a> to move the News Digest and Headlines pages to the
public population-awareness and also FTP to overpopulation.org .<font color=#BB0000>(this really does move it to the public page, so don't click on it unless you are ready)</font>.. Look for
the messages. The 'move' part goes fast, but the FTP takes awhile. Do not
wait too long for FTP - sometimes your browser bogs down even though the
files are sent - just proceed to step 5.
</li><p>

<b><li>Final review:</b> Check the two sites below to make sure they FTP'd OK (use
'Refresh' or 'Reload' to make sure you have the most recent copy of the
page) and make sure the date on the pages equals today's date (repeat the
'Advance' step above if the date is still not right after refreshing or reloading):

<p>
<font size=2 face=verdana>

Put the following URL in your address box on your browser, change document
ID in the last 6 digits of the URL, and with the cursor still in the
address box after the URL, hit ENTER.<br>

http://www.population-awareness.net/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/popaware/article.pl?display%login%006490
<br>
If you do not have the document number, go to one of the <a
href=#importantLinks>addresses above</a> and look for the article by using
search on the title or part of the title (hopefully someone will have told
you where to look for the article). 
<p>
There should be a red arrow or a grey button, or something (sometimes
invisible) to click on to the bottom right of (after the end of) the
article. Click on it.
<p>
This should bring you to a login box - enter your account number and click
'GO'.
<p>
Then you should see the WOA Article/Item Submittal form. It is a large form
with many options, but Publish Date, Source, Headline, Link, Summary, and
Full Article are the important ones. Plus at the bottom are one or two
columns that control where the article is to be placed. When using the 'Add
item to 1 or more 
section_subsection(s):' scroll box, you may choose more than one option. If
you choose more than one, hold down the CTRL key while you select the 2nd
and more. 
<p>
However, to just move the article along to the public page, check the 'Advance this item' and skip the above-mentioned scroll box.
<p>
When finished, hit SUBMIT.
<p>
