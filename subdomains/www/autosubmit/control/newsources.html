Bush's Plan to Dramatically Increase Developing Country Assistance (synopsis of a recent article). The U.S. will increase assistance to developing countries by 50% in the next 3 years, a $5 billion annual increase by FY 2006. A White House report says that in two generations, per capita income in developing countries has nearly doubled. Illiteracy has been cut by a third. Infant mortality in the poorest countries has been almost halved. However, over half of the world's population lives on less than $2 a day. To receive funding, countries must demonstrate a commitment to three goals: 1. Root out corruption, uphold human rights, adhere to the rule of law. 2. Invest in education, health care, and immunization. 3. Foster enterprise and entrepreneurship. Open markets, sustainable budgets and support for entrepreneurship unleash growth and prosperity. This will be the largest increase in foreign assistance in 40 years. The complaint has been raised that the new compact rewards past performance rather than future promise and the old system has not worked.
