If you haven't already done so, please go to the <a
href="http://www.overpopulation.org">WOA!! (World Overpopulation
Awareness)</a> web page and examine it to see how it is organized and to
get a general idea of the WOA!! philosophy.
<p>
<font face=arial size=3> <b>Keeping with WOA's Philosophy</b></font>
<p> 
WOA!! delves into the sensitive subjects of abortion, immigration, and
population control infrequently. 
<ul>
<li>On abortion, it is felt that family planning prevents abortion and
that there is still a large unmet need for family planning and contraceptive
services.</li>
<p>
<li>On population control, the program developed at the Cairo conference
and implemented by the UNFPA and the current program of USAID -
both involving voluntary family planning, reproductive health services,
availability of contraceptives, and education of women, is the most
politically acceptable and successful
means of lowering fertility rates.</li>
<p>
<li>On immigration, the fact that 98% of the world's population growth
is occuring in third world countries,   and that annual growth in the U.S.
due
to immigration is only 1% of the global growth, this web publication will
focus
on
  world overpopulation and contain anti-immigration sentiments to a very
small section of the total web page.
<p>
<li>It is important to remind readers often that something can be done
about overpopulation and to encourage them to
help, rather than take a doomsday approach.</li>
</ul>

<font face=arial size=3> <b>Being a WOA!! Editor</b></font>
Choose articles that are more fact than opinion. A limited number of
quotes are acceptable (one, or two, at most) - if the source is given.
 Statistics from reliable sources are very important. Re-word to avoid
copyright infringement. Summarize as much as possible, touching only on
key points, but do include all important statistics that may be 
used as reference later. Reliable sources are: the U.S. Census Bureau,
any U.N. agency, government agencies, research organizations,
such as World Watch (not Population Research Insitute), and university
research insitutes. Give credit to the source whenever possible.<p>
<p>
<font face=arial size=3> <b>Using the Article/Item Submittal
Form</b></font>
<p> 
<font face = "comic sans ms" size=3 color=blue>Don't be afraid to play -
you will be given a chance to preview your item before it 
is submitted.</font>
<p>
<font face = "comic sans ms" size=3 color=red>"Cut and Paste" is your
friend.</font>
<p>

The form is designed so that you do not have to worry about style. 99%
of
the style is already determined.
For example, in the News Scanner, the Date and Source of the article are
on
the top in small font,
followed by the Headline with a link (if available) behind it, followed
by
the body, and sometimes
editor's comments. An item on the Impacts page would have the source and
date following the article.
You do not have to worry about where these elements will appear - they
may
be arranged
in a different order in which you key them. Please use the HTML style
modifiers only if you really have to.
<p>
<a name=links></a>
<font face=arial size=3> <b>Links</b></font>
<p>
Links are pointers, that when clicked, will take you to somewhere else
on the Internet. They often appear as a different-colored text <font
color=blue><u>(commonly blue) that is underlined</u></font>. They consist of
two
parts: Some text, which is a caption, a name, or a description of where you
will
go to, and a hidden part, the URL, which is the web address of where the
web-surfer will go to. URL's usually start with www. or http://  &nbsp;
&nbsp;  In addition, a
link can be outside of the WOA!! web page, to a completely different
organization, or they can link back
to another part of WOA!! Almost always, you will be using the 'outside'
link
option.
<p>
<b>Links are very important.</b> WOA!! wants to avoid copying everything
and insteady usually uses a brief summary and then a pointer to another web
site where the full article resides. Some links expire in just a couple of
weeks, particularly newspaper links. Magazine links last somewhat longer,
maybe
indefinitely. If the link is to a newspaper article, it is often worthwhile
to
find a link to a press release or the original source of the article. If you
can
take the time to hunt down a link to the original source of the item, it
will
make the readers and WOA!! very happy not to click on a lost link. 
<p>
<font face=arial size=3> <b>Instructions for links within the body of an
article</b></font>
<br>
To build a link within the body of the article, you will need to 1)
click on the start inside or outside link option,  after which a strange
sequence
of characters will appear in your text box, 2) following the strange
text, enter the URL in the text box (cut and paste here ensures
accuracy), 3) click on the 'begin link text' option (more strange text),
4) enter the description or title, and 5) click on the end link text
option (more strange text).
<p>
<font size=4 face=arial> <b>Editor's comments</b></font>
<p>
On the News Scanner page, unless it is a rebuttal to an anti-family-
planning or anti- environment item, this field is reserved for the
editor-publisher, Karen. 
<p>
<font size=4 face=arial><b>Sections and Sub-sections</b> </font>
<p>
Note that the WOA!! web page has a table of contents on the left. Each
item on the left points to a 'section'. For example, some of the
sections are:
Population News, Impacts, Sprawl, FAQ/Facts, Urbanization, Birth
Control, and Teenage Pregnancy. Some of the  sections will have
'sub-sections'. For example, the section Impacts will have sub-sections
like Global Warming, Desertification and Deforestation, and Water Quality,
Pollution, and Species Extinction, while Sprawl section will have
sub-sections
such as
Transportation, Open Space, and 'What's Wrong with Cities?'
<p>
<font size=4 face=arial><b>Keywords</b> </font>
<p>
WOA!! intends to add a searchable index. It would be nice if someone who was
looking for an article on whales, could look it up in our index. That is
where
the 'keywords for search capability comes in.
<p>
Example: <font size=1 face=arial> August 4, 1999 Africa News
Service</font><b>
Ghana: Poverty and Increasing Population Leads to Eco-Disaster.</b>
Destruction
of the
 ecological system is attributed to poverty, increasing population,
 greed, carelessness, apathy, selfishness and sheer ignorance. Bad
 agricultural practices, misuse of agro-chemicals and small scale
 mining have left the soil infertile and degraded resulting in erosion
 and desertification. 
<p>
Suggested keywords for above article: <i>Ghana, poverty, agriculture,
fertilizer, desertification, erosion. (population is always the topic, so we
leave it out).</i>
