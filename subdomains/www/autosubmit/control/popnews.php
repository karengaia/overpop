Burgeoning Cities Face Catastrophe
June 28, 2007  Guardian (London) 

http://environment.guardian.co.uk/climatechange/story/0,,2113207,00.htm

Urban dwellers will outstrip rural population next year and a rise in poverty, slums and pollution. The shift will be led by Africa and Asia, which are expected to add 1.6 billion people to their cities over the next 25 years. 

The speed and scale of global urbanisation is so great most countries will not be prepared for the impact. Within one generation, five billion people, or 60% of humanity, will live in cities. 

The urban population of Africa and Asia will double in this time. Most cities in developing countries have pressing concerns, including crime, lack of clean water and sanitation, and sprawling slums. 

The changes are too fast to allow planners simply to react. If governments wait, it will be too late. 

Population growth will take place in the cities of Asia, Africa and Latin America. The largest transition to cities will occur in Asia,  where the number of urbanites will almost double to 2.6 billion in 2030. 

Africa is expected to add 440 million to its cities in the same period, and Latin America and the Caribbean nearly 200 million. 

Rural populations are expected to decrease worldwide by 28 million people. Cities concentrate poverty but present poor people's best hope of escaping it. 

The potential benefits of urbanisation outweigh the disadvantages. If unaddressed the growth will mean growth in slums and poverty, and a rise in migration away from poor regions. The battle to cut extreme poverty will be in the slums. 

Politicians need to be start working with the urban poor. Climate is expected to be shaped by cities. Climate change will increase energy demand for air conditioning and add to greenhouse gas emissions. It could also make some cities unlivable, adding to the "heat island" effect, which can lift temperatures in urban areas by 2-6C. 

Heat, pollution, smog and ground-level ozone affect surrounding areas, reducing agricultural yields, increasing health risks and spawning tornadoes and thunderstorms. The impacts of climate change on urban water supplies are expected to be dramatic. Developing countries are at a great disadvantage when they start to urbanise. 

If we plan ahead we will create conditions for a stable world. If we do not, then these populations will become destructive, to themselves and others.

US Florida: An Economy Tied to Growth
December 09, 2007  Sarasota Herald-Tribune 

http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20071209/COLUMNIST87/712090677/-1/newssitemap

How strong is Florida's economy? Despite the decline in home values, the rise in gas prices, the weak dollar, visitors are coming to Southwest Florida. Construction boomed from 2003 to 2006, and home prices in Florida rose 60%. Now there's a glut of unoccupied dwellings. 

It is anybody's guess when that industry will recover and help other sectors of an economy tied to population growth. 

Tourism has long been a mainstay of the state's economy. Why are people coming? At the top of the list is the weak dollar, which tends to draw Canadians and Europeans. Florida is transitioning from being a low-cost state to a higher-cost state, the Florida Chamber of Commerce Foundation Inc. said. The cost of living in Southwest Florida is comparable to the cost of living in Toronto. That explains why so many local residents are heading for points north. 

Florida's population increased by about 320,000 residents in 2006, down from the pace of 2004 and 2005. Most of the decrease was in domestic migration. Florida continued to attract residents from the Northeast and the Midwest, but Florida became a net exporter of residents to other Southern states." The state's population increased by 2.1 million people between 2000 and 2006. Factors causing some people to leave include high housing costs, rising property tax bills, difficulty obtaining insurance, the threat of hurricanes and recent job losses caused by the downturn in the construction industry. 

Good progress has been made in the past three years to strengthen the state's economy. At stake are the State's most vital current and future interests and the livability and sustainability of its communities. Floridians value the environment. The business community and politicians must do the same. Florida must continue to develop a diversified economic base. Local business and political leaders should draw research and development companies or, in some other form, companies that can diversify the local and state economies.

U.S.: Divorce Isn't Resource Efficient, Study Finds
December 04, 2007  Seattle Times 

http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2004051189_divorce04.html

Divorce can be bad for the environment. Each time a family dissolves, the result is two new households. Researchers concluded that in 2005, in the US alone, divorced households could have saved 38 million rooms, 73 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity and 627 million gallons of water compared to that of married households. 

11 other countries were examined, including Brazil, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Greece, Mexico and South Africa between 1998 and 2002. In these countries, if divorced households had combined to have the same average household size as married households, there could have been a million fewer households using energy and water. With the number of divorces rising, so is the number of households, outpacing population growth itself.

World Facing Daunting Task to Realize Anti-Poverty Goals
December 04, 2007  Xinhua General News Service http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-12/05/content_7200481.htm

The world is facing a daunting task to realize the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). World leaders launched the MDGs, which include halving the number of people suffering from poverty and hunger, promoting gender equality, increasing access to education and health resources and improving environmental sustainability. 

The collective record so far has been mixed. The benchmarks on development and health care targets was poor at 2007, the midpoint between the adoption of the MDGs and the 2015 target date. Worldwide, the number of people in developing countries living on less than 1 U.S. dollar a day fell to 980 million in 2004, from 1.25 billion in 1990 and the proportion of people living in extreme poverty fell 19% over this period. If the trend continues, the MDG poverty reduction target will be met. 

More children in developing countries are going to school. Enrollment in education rose from 80% in 1991 to 88% in 2005. Child mortality subsided and progress was made in controlling malaria and tuberculosis. An overall success in realizing the MDGs is far from assured. More than 5 million children die from malnutrition each year, death toll from AIDS keeps rising, half the population of the developing world still has no access to basic sanitation, and the potentially catastrophic effects of climate change are already being felt. Only one out of eight regional groups is on track to meet all the goals by 2015 and the gains were unevenly distributed. 

In Western Asia, the poverty rate more than doubled during the same period. In Africa, no single country will meet all the goals and the continent lags far behind. Sub-Saharan Africa is behind schedule on all of the MDGs with 41.1% of its population living on 1 dollar a day or less. Environment degradation, gender inequalities, high HIV prevalence and on-going wars are seriously impeding international efforts to achieve the MDGs. International cooperation on implementing the development agenda has been moving slowly as a trend of giving priority to security over development persists. 

Wars go on in many parts of the world and terrorism and other unconventional threats pose a growing threat to international security. The MDGs cannot be achieved by the poorest countries without resources provided by donors in the developed world. There has not been an increase in Official Development Assistance (ODA) since 2004. Total official development assistance declined in real terms by 5.1% between 2005 and 2006 and is expected to continue through 2007 as debt relief declines further. The EU member states have promised to achieve the ODA target of 0.7% gross national income by 2015 but only Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden, have met the target. Despite promises by the industrialized countries to double their aid, little has been done so far. Aid to the least developed countries has stalled since 2003 and aid to sub-Saharan Africa, increased by only 2% between 2005 and 2006. It is imperative that all stakeholders meet the commitments in the Millennium Declaration. The MDGs are still achievable if the international community takes urgent and concerted action. 

Karen Gaia says: personally, I can't see how we can raise the poor's standard of living monetarily, considering how resource depletion has become so bad. Providing food, health, and education may be all we can do. But we must try and the first thing that must be done is to reverse population growth. The second is to cut overconsumption of the rich. Both have to happen!!

Report: U.S. Teen Births Rise
December 05, 2007  Associated Press 

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071205/ap_on_he_me/teen_births;_ylt=AmrlYvgYP84PMIVd7sHFh_B34T0D

The nation's teen birth rate has risen for the first time in 14 years. The birth rate had been dropping since 1991, but government statisticians said it jumped 3% from 2005 to 2006. For 2006 births to unmarried mothers hit a new record high, and the overall birth rate has climbed to its highest level since 1971. 

The teen increase was based on the 15-19 age group, which accounted for about 99% of the more than 440,000 births to teens in 2006. The rate rose to 41.9 live births per 1,000 females in that age group, up from 40.5 in 2005.

Sustainable Development is Need of the Time
December 08, 2007  The Daily Star http://www.thedailystar.net/story.php?nid=14715

The idea of sustainable development grew from environmental movements in earlier decades and was defined in 1987 as: "Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs." When you think of the world as a system, you understand that air pollution from North America affects air quality in Asia, and that pesticides sprayed in Argentina could harm fish stocks off the coast of Australia. 

You start to realise that the decisions our grandparents made about how to farm the land continue to affect agricultural practice today. We understand that quality of life is a system, too. What if you are poor and don't have access to education? It's good to have a secure income, but what if the air in your part of the world is unclean? And it's good to have freedom of religious expression, but what if you can't feed your family? 

The concept of sustainable development helps us understand ourselves and our world. The problems we face are complex and serious, and we can't address them in the same way we created them. Sustainable development highlights sustainability as the idea of environmental, economic and social progress and equity, all within the limits of the world's natural resources. Sustainable development calls for improving the quality of life for all of the world's people without increasing the use of our natural resources beyond the Earth's carrying capacity. 

The efforts to build a truly sustainable way of life require the integration of action in three key areas: Interlinked, global economic systems demand an integrated approach to foster responsible long-term growth while ensuring that no nation or community is left behind. To conserve our environment and natural resources for future generations, economically viable solutions must be developed to reduce resource consumption, stop pollution and conserve natural habitats. 

Throughout the world, people require jobs, food, education, energy, health care, water, and sanitation. The world community must ensure that the cultural and social diversity, and the rights of workers, are respected, and that all members of society are empowered to play a role in determining their futures. The record on sustainability so far appears to have been quite poor. Sustainable development is an urgent issue, though political will has been slow-paced. 

There are 1.3 billion without access to clean water. About half of humanity lack access to adequate sanitation and living on less than 2 dollars a day. In practicing sustainable development over the long-term one will: 
-- Not diminish the quality of the present environment. 
-- Not reduce the availability of renewable resources. 
-- Take into consideration the value of non-renewable resources to future generations. 
-- Not compromise the ability of other species or future generations to meet their needs.

U.N.: Ignoring Global Warming Is "Criminally Irresponsible"
December 10, 2007  Associated Press 

In the fourth and last report issued this year by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the U.N.'s top climate official warned that ignoring the urgency of global warming would be "criminally irresponsible." Environmentalists and authors of the report expected tense discussions on what to include and leave out of the document.
 
Scientists were determined to "adhere to standards of quality" in the report. It was indirect barb at the government representatives, who have been accused of watering down and excluding vital information to fit their domestic agendas. The document sums up the scientific consensus on how rapidly the Earth is warming and the effects already observed;. The IPCC already has established that the climate has begun to change because of the greenhouse gases. 

Global warming will hit the poorest countries hardest. Failing to recognize the urgency of this message and act on it would be nothing less that criminally irresponsible. 

A new conference will begin exploring a global strategy to curb greenhouse gas emissions after the expiration of the first phase of the Kyoto Protocol According to an early draft the report will be the first to include a chapter on "robust findings and key uncertainties," in which the authors pick out what they believe are the most relevant certainties and doubts about climate change. Among the uncertainties cited: the lack of data from key areas of the world, conflicting studies on the effects of cloud cover and carbon soaked up by oceans, and projections on how planners in developing countries will factor climate change into their decisions. 

The IPCC has been criticized for the language of the policy summaries, which have been softened on several points because of objections by countries including the USA, China and some big oil-producing nations such as Saudi Arabia. One of several environmental groups invited to observe the process, said "governments cut vital facts and important information" during the negotiations. The WWF accused governments of "politically inspired trimming" of facts which diluted the urgency to make deep cuts in emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.

China: Healthcare Services to Improve
December 11, 2007  China.org.cn http://www.china.org.cn/english/health/234630.htm

In China, measures have been adopted to decrease birth defects and monitor the side  effects of contraceptive methods and equipment, director of the National Population and Family Planning Commission said in Beijing. They will train more consultants to advise couples on ensuring babies' health and using contraceptives. 

More than 1.26 million women in Dalian have free gynecological checkups funded by the family planning commission. The commission distributed pamphlets on family medicine to local households, and nearly all of the city's pregnant women were given free nutritional supplements. 

About 8,000 migrant workers in Dalian received free checkups, and those with reproductive organ diseases were treated for free. Over the past two years, the city has spent more than 22 million yuan to provide free contraceptive medicine and equipment for its migrant workers and unemployed.

Too Many Women Dying in Childbirth
December 11, 2007  IRIN News (UN) http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=75628

The United Nations Population Fund has launched a campaign in Burkina Faso to reduce maternal mortality. It aims to reach 80% of women at the age to procreate in rural areas, and 50% in the cities. In Burkina Faso, 63% of women see a doctor while they are pregnant, of whom only 23% do so regularly. 

Burkina Faso has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the region, with 484 women dying per 100,000 deliveries. The three-month campaign will include radio and television programs, to educate people about the advantages of prenatal consultations and the advantages of delivering at health care centres. Discussions will also be conducted with men and traditional leaders. Each message displays also men because people should not think that assisted delivery concerns only women because men are most often the final decision-makers. 

Burkina Faso was revealed as being the least-developed country in the world among the 177 that UNDP evaluates. Niger jumped up four positions. Since 1990 it has registered a 10-year rise in life expectancy and an 8% increase in school attendance, and the level of adult literacy has improved by 17%. Niger ranks worse than Burkina Faso for birth and health related issues, 16% of births are in the presence of a health official compared to 38% in Burkina Faso. 

Burkina Faso is facing a shortage of qualified medical personnel. There are five physicians per 100,000 people. It is expensive to train medical staff and many people cannot afford to pay to use their services.

China Population to Reach 1.5 Billion by 2033
December 4, 2007  Reuters http://in.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idINIndia-30815820071204

China's population, now 1.3 billion, would reach 1.45 to 1.46 billion by 2020, before reaching a peak of 1.5 billion in 2033. China is adding 16 million people a year. By 2012, annual population increase will reach a peak of 19 million. With the world's biggest population straining scarce land, water and energy resources, China has enforced rules to restrict family size since the 1970s. Rules vary but usually limit families to one child, or two in the countryside. 

China's policies have prevented several hundred million births and boosted prosperity, but experts warned of a looming social time-bomb from an ageing population and widening gender disparity stemming from a traditional preference for boys. Population controls are being unravelled by the increased mobility of China's 150 million-odd migrant workers, who travel from poor rural areas to work in more affluent eastern cities. 

The influx of migrant workers into the capital had seen Beijing's population reach 17.4 million, Only 600,000 short of a ceiling of 18 million the city government had set for 2020. China has vowed to slap heavier fines on wealthy citizens who flout family planning laws, in response to the emergence of an upper class willing to pay standard fines to have more children.

Climate Change Underway in US
December 11, 2007  Voice of America http://www.voanews.com/english/Science/2007-12-11-voa27.cfm

The non-profit Pew Center on Global Climate Change released a report examining the impact climate change is having on different regions of the United States. With international climate talks under way, the report argues that federal, state and local decision-makers must work both to mitigate global warming and to adapt to its consequences. 

The report finds that climate change in U.S. is underway and looks at specific impacts. It finds that Midwestern heat waves and Western wildfires are both likely to become larger, more frequent and more intense. Gulf Coast wetland loss and Chesapeake 'dead zones' are likely to be exacerbated by climate change. The studies consider how population growth, development, and land management interact with the problems of a warming planet. 

A coastal scientist says that wetlands restoration is critical to life and the economy of the Gulf Coast. Continued coastal development coupled with the anticipated rise in sea levels could drown the wetlands. Under storm events such as hurricanes, these open waters increase the risk of coastal flooding More wild fires are likely if forests are not managed for climate change. 

The report notes that earlier spring snowmelt and hotter, drier summers have led to more wildfires. Carbon dioxide, also promotes tree growth. But that may cause problems, unless the growth is managed properly to lessen fire risk. Agricultural runoff from farms and cities has led to an inadequate level of oxygen in the The Chesapeake Bay, coastal waters and dead zones, which affect fisheries and recreation in the region. 

The future of the Chesapeake Bay is compromised by climate change. Every planner, every developer, every policy maker, will have to factor climate change into the equation. Getting the right policies in place now is essential to reducing the risk from current and future climate-change impacts.

Democrats Lose Fight to Ease Restrictions on International Groups That Offer Abortions
December 17, 2007  The Associated Press 

Democrats have backed down on their insistence that the 2008 Foreign Aid budget reverse President Bush's ban on providing aid to family planning groups that offer abortions. A measure to ease restrictions was stripped from a $500 billion-plus spending bill, which includes $35 billion for the State Department and foreign aid programs. 

Congress is expected to pass the bill this week. Democrats blamed the White House for threatening to block the bill if it included the measure. "This adherence to an illogical position diminishes our influence around the world" said Rep. Nita Lowey. Bush has prohibited any assistance to organizations overseas that perform or promote abortion. 

Democrats say an unintended consequence is a shortage of contraceptives, particularly in poor rural areas. In June, the House voted to allow any overseas organization to obtain U.S.- donated contraceptives. The Senate followed suit with a measure that would have reversed Bush's ban entirely. "If we provide contributions or anything of value to pro-abortion organizations in other countries, we enable them to expand abortion," said Rep. Christopher Smith. 

"It is unconscionable for a president to ignore the majority of the members of Congress, Americans and the best interests of millions of human beings because he is blinded by his own narrow beliefs," said Amy Coen.

Capping Greenhouse Gases
July 05, 2007  The Independent Weekly http://www.indyweek.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A156598

Durham ranks above the national average in amount of greenhouse gases generated per person. Durham unveiled its proposed Greenhouse Gas Inventory and Local Action Plan that details local sources and amounts of pollutants and offers solutions for curbing them. The plan recommends that by 2030 local government should reduce its emissions by 50%; residential, commercial and industrial sectors, 30%. 

Without these cuts, Durham will emit more than 10 million tons of greenhouse gases annually. The county paid a Canadian consulting company, ICLEI, $55,000 for the inventory and plan. If approved Durham would be the first county in North Carolina to adopt such a measure. The reductions must occur as the county's population is expected to increase by 25% by 2030. "We have to cut greenhouse gases against the backdrop of population growth," says Rob Jackson, biology professor at Duke University's Nicholas School of the Environment. 

"Like a diet, it takes discipline. It takes a group of people to keep the topic in front of City Council and the community all the time." The plan calls for a sustainability coordinator, who would educate the public about energy conservation and monitor progress toward meeting reductions. The city and the county would fund the position, and each has allocated $50,000 to implement the plan. 

The sustainability coordinator is only as effective as local government, he should coordinate land use, transportation, trees and recycling into the greenhouse gas plan. In addition to car and truck emissions, electricity usage, much of it generated from coal, is Durham's main culprit. 

And the city, is wasting millions of dollars on energy costs that could go toward efficiency and conservation. Many energy-saving measures have not been implemented nor are there many incentives for energy efficiency. Durham County and Duke University have built or retrofitted seven facilities to meet Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) standards, the national certification for green building. 

The City of Durham has no LEED-certified buildings. A lack of money and direction eight years ago put Durham behind in its emissions reductions. We need a mandatory plan as soon as possible.

Report From Africa: Population, Health, Environment, and Conflict
July 03, 2007  Woodrow Wilson International Centre for Scholars Author 

http://allafrica.com/sustainable/resources/view/00011158.pdf

Authors in the latest ECSP Report argue that we should not miss the quiet - yet often more lethal - conflicts for shrinking resources, which are depleted by population growth, environmental degradation, poverty, and over-consumption. Population and health are linked to conflict and fragile states, say report authors. 

Efforts to promote sustainability - and use natural resources as peacebuilding tools -c ould help turn deadly environments into sustainable neighborhoods. In managing our resources, we need to realize they are limited and need to be managed Sustainable management of the resources is only possible if we practice good governance. That we respect the voice of the minority, while accepting the decision of the majority. 

We call for the strengthening of institutions, such as the United Nations to restrain strong nations so that they do not walk all over the weak ones. When we manage our resources sustainably and practice good governance we promote cultures of peace, which include the willingness to dialogue and make genuine efforts for healing and reconciliation.

Philippines: Bishops Reject Birth Control
December 14, 2007  Manila Standard 

The Catholic Church will stand firm in its position against the use of contraceptives, the Bishops in the Philippines said. Archbishop Lagdameo said no matter how many surveys claim the increasing support for family planning methods, the Church will never waver in its support for natural methods to plan families. 

Surveys favoring contraceptives will not alter the Church's position. The use of birth controls would not change the objectives of the moral law on contraceptives. A US-based organization claimed that the support for contraceptive use should serve as an indicator for the Church to reconsider its stand. The group cited a survey by the Catholics for Free Choice showing that 77% of Filipino Catholics believe that using condoms is pro-life because it saves lives by preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. 

Msgr. Quitorio downplayed the result of the local survey. He also belied reports that condoms prevent the spread of STDs. In Thailand for example, he said, the more they use condoms, the more the AIDS become widespread. He said that statistically, there is no proof that condoms can prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. 


Ralph says: The church should require it's priests to know mathmatics

U.K.: Women to Be Able to Get Pill on Demand at Local Pharmacy
December 13, 2007  Guardian (London) 

Women will be able to get the contraceptive pill from their chemist under new plans revealed by the government. They will be able to walk into the chemist's and obtain the pill after a discreet conversation with the pharmacist. It had not yet been decided whether girls under 16 would be able to get the pill without their parents being informed. 

The morning-after pill is already available to women including under-age girls from a pharmacist, if he or she is satisfied that they are competent to make the decision to take it and are in good health. Any woman getting the pill would involve a questionnaire about her health and other medication she might be taking. It could also mean that the pharmacist would take her blood pressure. Pharmacists will be given extra training. 

The move towards pharmacy availability is intended to make life easier for women. Pharmacies could play an increased role in the provision of contraception and other sexual health services because of their accessibility and convenient opening hours. For the change to come about, strategic health authorities must issue instructions called patient group directions, permitting pharmacists to prescribe specific medicines to specific groups of people. 

Not only the morning-after pill but also cholesterol-lowering statins are available from pharmacists, who carry out checks to ensure the drugs are suitable for those who request them. The Department of Health wants to increase the range of medicines available this way.

Population Explosion Threatens Development Gains
December 18, 2007  Africa News Service http://allafrica.com/stories/200712110641.html

If the people of Niger remain uninformed about family planning and keep reproducing at the current rate the country's population will quadruple by 2050. Niger's population is counted by the Institute for National Statistics (INS), which calculates the current rate of population growth is 3.3% every year. 

If that growth continues, there will be 56 million people living in Niger by 2050, compared to 13.5 million today. The average number of children per mother is 7.1. When asked how many they would like to have - women said nine and men said 12, but some families said they would like 40 or 50 children. 

This is a society that encourages procreation. Just 5% of Nigeriens use family planning and contraception. The 85% of Nigeriens who currently rely on rain-fed subsistence agriculture, are going to be hardest hit as millions more people compete for the same farmland. Niger's cultivatable land could be less because of soil degradation and the effects of climate change. It has been identified as one of the regions most likely to be adversely affected by climate change. 

The increase in population will accentuate the cereal production and wood-for-fuel deficits which started in the 1980s. Niger's population will also overtake the government's ability to provide adequate health, education, jobs and even water points. The capital Niamey remains small compared to most Sahelian capitals with a population of around 700,000. At least 85% of the Nigerien population relies on rainfed subsistence farming. 94% of Nigeriens live on 35% of the land. 

The most populated areas are along the southern border with Burkina Faso and Mali. The Maradi region,, holds 20% of the population, some 2,235,748 people, living on 3.3% of the country's land. Niger's desert and mountain north accounts for 53% of Niger's territory but is inhabited by only 3% of the population - 321,639 people. 

Niger's government put in place a "national action plan" to curb population growth. The government wants the number practising family planning to increase from 5% to 15% or 20% by 2015. The plan also calls for information campaigns to educate religious leaders and especially women about the availability and importance of family planning. It proposes that early marriages be cut. Currently, every second girl is married and likely to be procreating before the age of 15. Raising the marriage age to 18 would take up to four years off a woman's reproductive life. 

By 2015 population growth should have slowed to 2.5% and the average number of children produced per woman should be five. If the demographics continue, Niger cannot develop. All the resources will be going into social services and nothing will be left for investing in the economy.

China: Baby Boom Set to Start Next Year
December 18, 2007  China Daily http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2007-12/12/content_6314388.htm

A mini-baby boom is expected to start next year. The minister of the National Population and Family Planning Commission, expects the boom to last for more than 10 years and put great pressure on the government in its efforts to manage population growth. However, the boom will be relatively small in comparison to those of the early 1950s and 60s and the late 80s. 

Many of the children born in the years following the introduction of the national family planning policy in 1973, are now of marriageable age. A change in the law that allowed rural couples to have a second child if their first was a girl has created a spike in the number of people approaching the age for marriage. Over the past 30-plus years, the family planning policy has stabilized the country's population, as well as aiding economic and social development. 

According to official figures, the average number of children born to each family is currently 1.8, compared to 5.8 in the early 70s. Despite the regulations, the country is facing a challenge to keep the number of births down. The desire to have boys or more than one child is deep-rooted - especially in rural areas. A survey showed that nearly 80% of couples said that they wanted to have both a boy and a girl. 

About 41% of couples in urban areas whose first child was a girl said that they wanted to have a boy. Couples within the floating rural population, which is estimated at about 140 million, often unlawfully have more than one child outside their hometowns to escape government inspection.

Yemen: PM Warns of Population Growth on Social, Economic Security
December 18, 2007  Saba Net http://www.sabanews.net/en/news143161.htm

Prime Minister Ali Mujawar warned against the population growth on social and economic security. He called for adopting decentralization in carrying out programs related to population activities, asking governors and local councils to shoulder their responsibility. He emphasized the importance of finding a system of monitoring and evaluating performance of the population policy. 

He made clear that the government would coordinate with the parliament to issue laws to support health programs for mothers and children. Mujawar highlighted support of donors for the population policy in Yemen, wishing success for the conference. The core of the problem is the gap between annual economic growing rate and population growth which is one of the highest rates in the world, 3%. 

The health ministry is working to cover needs of the reproductive health for the coming five years. The government will establish a population sector in the health ministry. Reduction of poverty, sustainable development and economic growth is required for tackling population problems. UNPFA confirmed commitment of the fund to support efforts of Yemen in fields of population, development and health reproductive. and highlighted achievements in spheres of girl education and women empowerment.

Mali: Child Marriage a Neglected Problem
September 05, 2007  Irin News http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?ReportId=74027

More than 60 million women globally were married before the age of 18. Child marriage is a problem that has been largely untouched by the international community. There hasn't been a really concerted effort to address the issue. 

In Mali a bill that would raise the legal age of marriage to 18 has been on the books for five years, but has yet to be passed. Malian law punishes the abduction of women for forced marriage by one to five years in prison. When the abducted girl is less than 15 years old, the sentence is up to 10 years of forced labour. Enforcing the law is difficult, because family members are often accomplices. 

According to the latest statistics from 65% of women aged 20-24 were married by the age of 18, 25% were married by 15, and one in 10 married girls aged 15-19 gave birth before age 15. The decline in early marriage in Mali has been attributed to the few education and awareness raising programmes. In the western region, where 83% of girls are married by 18, particular effort has been paid to informing people of the risks of early marriage. 

According to UNFPA, girls aged 15-19 are twice as likely to die during pregnancy or childbirth as women aged 20-24. Among girls aged 10-14, the risk is five times greater. Early onset of sexual activity has also been linked to increased risk of HIV/AIDS. 

In Kayes, between 2005 and May 2007, at least 10 girls lost their lives because of complications after their wedding nights, sometimes due to haemorrhaging after forced intercourse. CAFO joined with UNICEF, and the union of independent radio and TV stations, to organise the first public awareness campaign in the region of Kayes. It included a three-day workshop with religious and community leaders, helping them produce messages against early marriage to be broadcast in the local media. 

For the last two years, UNICEF has also been working with communities in three regions of Mali - Segou, Mopti and Kayes - to inform residents of the risks, help them abandon the practice, and set up committees that will intervene in cases of early 
marriage. UNFPA runs educational programmes focusing on reproductive health that include early marriage. 

Legal enforcement must be combined with programmes that provide alternatives to early marriage by increasing the levels of education and economic opportunities of girls. The Malian government does consider child marriage a form of violence, and there is a policy to fight against violence done to women. Making early marriage a political priority is a necessary first step for change.
