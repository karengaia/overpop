<p>    <i class="redquote">This growth will produce serious challenges 
for our society. I believe that many of our present social problems may 
be related to the fact that we have had only fifty years in which to 
accommodate the second hundred million Americans. In fact, since 1945 
alone some 90 million babies have been born in this country. We have 
thus had to accommodate in a very few decades an adjustment to 
population growth which was once spread over centuries. And now it 
appears that we will have to provide for a third hundred million 
Americans in a period of just 30 years.</i>

NumbersUSA believes that federal immigration policies are the cause of 
most U.S. population growth. The clickable population maps on this 
website (follow the link) will help you see at a glance where 
immigration is driving the most population growth and radical change 
across the country. Nearly every county that is colored for high growth 
either (a) has had a lot of immigration, or (b) has had a lot of 
migration of Americans fleeing other parts of the state or country. You 
can click on the metro areas on a state map to obtain zoomed-in maps.</p>

<p>NOTE: the maps do an excellent job of showing population growth, 
which is horrific in many places. They do not actually show where growth
 is due to direct immigration, or flight from other areas due to traffic
 congestion or other factors, as opposed to a high birth rate.

<div class="comment">Karen Gaia says: For example, the map shows that 
California is ranked as Number 12 in growth, growing by 54% from 1980 to
 2008. However, after WWII, the high growth rate was due to migration of
 mostly natives to California. And in the 1960's there was a large baby 
boom in the U.S., with an average of four children per couple. The 
1980's saw the children of those baby boomers being born. California 
shares a border with Mexico and large numbers of legal and illegal 
immigrants cross the border there. Many of them go back and forth. There
 is no doubt that more recently immigration, if you include children 
born to immigrants, is responsible for the higher growth rate in the 
last two decades. But the birth rate is higher than the immigration rate
 in Calif. Best to address unintended pregnancies, which run about 50%. 
Even Catholics, many of them, practice birth control after 1 or 2 kids, 
if given the means.</div>

<p>
If the U.S. population, now approximately 300 million, were to keep 
increasing at the current rate, we'll reach 400 million by 2043. 
"Population growth is the ever expanding denominator that gives each 
person a shrinking share of the resource pie," Lester Brown of the Earth
 Policy says. "It contributes to water shortages, cropland conversion to
 non-farm uses, traffic congestion, more garbage,  overfishing, a 
growing dependence on imported oil and other conditions that diminish 
the quality of our daily lives."</p>

<p>In other developed countries, populations have either slightly 
dropped or stayed constant. "It may be time for the United States to 
establish a national population policy, one that would lead toward 
population stabilization sooner rather than later," Brown says. It may 
be important to switch the focus toward population stabilization and 
then decide how to stretch the resources among society.

America Galloping Toward Its Greatest Crisis in the 21st Century.
</a></h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
May 22, 2009 &nbsp;
Examiner.com - By Frosty Wooldridge</span>
<p>
At current growth rates, America expects to add 100 million people by 
2035 - only 26 years from now. Yet the mainstream media says nothing, 
not even our favorite, most imformative, newscasters. And environmental 
groups, like the Sierra Club won't address the core cause of it all: 
overpopulation. </p>

<p>No matter how many water shortage reports, climate change indicators,
 mass species extinctions or air pollution stories you read about, 
America blissfully adds 3.2 million people annually. </p>

<p>Another 77 million humans add themselves, net gain, to the planet 
annually and 1.0 billion add to the globe every 12 years.</p>

<p>Such a population growth cannot be sustained. Religious, cultural 
interests, and big business push the growth ever faster. </p>

<p>Distractors write that overpopulation is a New World Order myth or 
that the 'Illuminati' expect to kill off half the human population or 
some other nonsense. Mother Nature, who kills 18 million humans from 
starvation and related diseases annually, is ultimate population Nazi!</p>

<p>From 'WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE' by Paul R. Ehrlich and Anne H. Ehrlich, 
November 6, 2008 and www.dominantanimal.org (click on 'Further 
Information'), here is an outline what we should do:</p>

<p>One: put births on a par with deaths --</p>

<p>"Human beings have always fought against early death from accident, 
hunger, and sickness, and in the past century or so have employed 
improved sanitation and the use of pesticides and antibiotics to raise 
life expectancy. But given the frightening potential consequences of the
 explosion in human numbers that has followed reductions of the death 
rate, it is essential to pay equivalent attention to reducing high 
birthrates as well. Programs to educate and open job opportunities for 
women, and to make effective contraception universally available, must 
be an integral part of development policies in poor countries. Placing 
women in important cabinet posts in a new U.S. administration should 
have high priority and would send a strong signal in support of women's 
empowerment (even in developed nations, prejudice against women is 
widespread)."</p>

<p>"And, of course, a global discussion over the next several decades 
will be required to reach a consensus on those lifestyles and thus on 
the appropriate maximum population size - which we already know must be 
smaller than the present 6.7 billion."</p>

<p>Two: emphasize conserving more than consuming --</p>

<p>"At any given level of technology, there is a trade-off between the 
numbers of people in a society and the level of per capita physical 
affluence that can be sustainably supported. The more people there are, 
the smaller each one's share of the pie must be. One way of dealing with
 this unavoidable trade-off would be a cultural shift away from creating
 ever more gadgets to creating more appreciation and better stewardship 
of Earth's aesthetic assets." We need "careful husbandry of manufactured
 and natural capital (our ecological assets), and a crash program to 
abandon the use of fossil fuels and transition to sustainable energy 
technologies, would eventually permit most people to live satisfactory 
lives." We must abandon "the irrational idea that constant growth in 
consumption is automatically good and can continue forever."</p>

<p>Three: judge technologies not just on what they do for people but 
also to people and their life-support systems</p>

<p>"A novel synthetic chemical added to the plastic in a sports bottle 
may increase its durability, but if it leaches into a baby bottle's 
contents or into the environment and functions in tiny doses as an 
endocrine-disrupting agent, is the risk worth the benefit?"</p>

<p>Four: transform the consumption of education</p>

<p>"It is widely recognized that literacy and civic education are keys 
to 'development;' they could also be keys to sustainable development. 
Reform of education to help us solve the human predicament is thus 
crucial."</p>

<p>Five: rapidly expand our empathy</p>

<p>"We're a small-group animal, trying to live in large groups." .. "Can
 affluent people in the West learn to empathize enough with a child in 
Darfur so as to take real action to save her? Can they learn to care 
about the world her grandchildren will live in, and act to move that 
society towards peaceful sustainability? If the global community takes 
step five, the answers to both questions will be 'yes,' and we'll be on 
the kind of road that could lead to a level of global cooperation that 
might allow a billion or two, perhaps three billion, small-group animals
 to live together sustainably in relative peace, in the next century.</p>

<p>Six: decide what kind of world we all want</p>

<p>"What are the ultimate goals of our lives?" .. "Are Americans really 
happier traveling to work an hour or more each day wrapped in a ton or 
two of steel and breathing smog that threatens their lives? While the 
U.S. GDP has multiplied almost five times since 1958, satisfaction, as 
shown by surveys, has not increased at all."</p>

<p>"We could initiate a Millennium Assessment of Human Behavior (MAHB) 
to begin a discussion of what economic, social, and political systems 
will best fulfill human desires as we struggle to live in gigantic, 
culturally diverse groups."  ... "The USA could meet developing cultures
 halfway by focusing less on 'standard of living' and more on 'quality 
of life,' and it could bring the experts along with it."

<p>If recent trends show that contraception is a great form of 
protection against uncertain times and many are opting for the permanent

because I care about people's right and capability to control their

sounding racist, because Americans have been relatively well off, up to 
now, but the same holds true the world over. People and governments who 
feel they suffer bad economic times benefit by cutting down their 
planned family size or delaying a pregnancy. Resources are not without

More U.S. Babies Born in 2007 Than Any Other Year.
</h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
March 19, 2009 &nbsp;
Chattanooga Times Free Press</span>
<p>
More U.S. babies entered the world in 2007 than any other year in the 
nation's history and represents a 1% increase over the prior year. Some 
are concerned about another year's rise in teen births, after hitting an
 all-time low in 2005, and a record number of births to unwed mothers.</p>

<p>The U.S. birth rate for teenagers 15 to 17 years old rose in 2007 by 
about 1%, to 22.2 births per 1,000 girls. Our population is at an 
all-time high with an increase in the number of women of childbearing 
age
.
An influx of immigrants and a growing minority of groups that tend to 
have higher fertility rates contributed to a higher birth rate.</p>

<p>In 2007, fertility rates increased in all racial groups by 1% 
percent, to 69.5 births per 1,000 women age 15 to 44, the highest level 
since 1990.</p>

<p>The year's total fertility rate is 2.1 children per mother, only 
slightly higher than past years, and the increase cannot compare to the 
impact of the post-World War II baby boom. Some of this boom is from 
single mothers.</p>

<p>In 2007, births to unwed mothers hit a record high of nearly 40%, 
continuing a trend fueled by a lessening of the stigma on single 
parenthood. More than three-
quarters of those unmarried mothers were over 20.</p>

<p>As the economic recession continues, the rising birth rates may not 
last. The lowest birth rates in the US occurred during the Great 
Depression before modern contraception.

Oh, Baby! US Breaks Birth Record; Unwed Mothers Had 40 Percent of Babies
 Born in 2007.
</a></h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
March 18, 2009 &nbsp;
ClickOrlando.com</span>
<p>
More babies were born in the US in 2007 than in the nation's history. 
There is good and bad news for the more than 4.3 million births:</p>

<p>The U.S. population is more than replacing itself, a healthy trend.
However, the teen birth rate was up for the second year in a row.</p>

<p>The birth rate rose slightly for women of all ages, births to unwed 
mothers reached an all-time high of about 40%. More than three-quarters 
of these women were 20 or older.</p>

<p>It's become more acceptable for women to have babies without a 
husband. Happy couples may be living together without getting married. 
Some cited a growing trend among all adult women to have children 
regardless of their marital status.</p>

<p>Countries with much lower rates face future labor shortages and 
eroding tax bases as they fail to reproduce enough to take care of their
 aging elders.</p>

<p>Some experts think birth rates are declining because of the economic 
recession that began in late 2007.</p>

<p>The 2007 snapshot reflected a relatively good economy coupled with 
cultural trends that promoted childbirth.</p>

<p>U.S. abortions have been dropping to their lowest levels in decades. 
Some attributed this decline to better use of contraceptives, but others
 have wondered if the rise in births might indicate a failure in proper 
use of contraceptives.</p>

<p>Teen women tend to follow what their older sisters do, so teen births
 are going up just like births to older women. The numbers also showed:</p>

<p>Cesarean sections  continue to rise, to almost a third of all births,
 much higher than is medically necessary.</p>

U.S.: Immigration, Population and Politics.

California had about 27 million residents when Californians for 
Population Stabilization (CAPS) was formed in 1986 to raise alarms about
 the impacts of continued population growth. California now has about 38
 million residents. If California continues to grow, it faces 
environmental degradation.</p>

<p>Many of the problems facing California today have one root cause: too
 many people. As California's population grows by a half-million or more
 each year, virtually all of that growth stems from immigration, legal 
and illegal.</p>

<p>Population growth, creates the demand for more housing, more water, 
more schools, more highways - more of everything and that puts pressure 
on the environment.</p>

<p>Overpopulation driven by unsustainable levels of immigration is 
bringing on more traffic congestion, escalating energy prices, 
overcrowding of our beaches, parks and recreational areas, and 
increasing demands on our limited water supply.</p>

<p>That said, while the low- or no-growth policies might lessen the 
environmental issues, they would also create new and difficult economic 
and social problems.</p>

<p>Shortages of trained workers are looming in California. Low-growth 
countries such as Japan are already feeling that pinch.</p>

<p>Without ever-expanding, tax-generating construction, employment and 
retail sales, state and local governments would be compelled to raise 
taxes on an aging population with fixed incomes.</p>

<p>Changes of political policy often produce unintended consequences.

<div class="comment">Karen Gaia says: add more workers to solve the 
aging population problem and you will have those workers becoming aged 
themselves one day. Who will take care of them? It is an insane pyramid 
scheme to keep growing the population to take care of the aged. 
Regarding immigration contributing to growth, most of California's 
growth is due to births, many of which are unintended and can be 
prevented - regardless of whether or not the parents are native born. 
There are many legislative measures that affect California's fertility. 
Let us work on them!!!</div>

U.S. Population Landmarks.

<span class="smallfont"> 
January 4, 2010 &nbsp;
George Plumb of Vermonters for Sustainable Population</span>
<p>
1915 - Margaret Sanger brought the diaphragm from the Netherlands to the
 U.S. It was the first truly effective birth control device under the 
control of women.</p>

<p>1916 - Margaret Sanger organized the first birth control clinic in 
Brooklyn, N.Y. In 1921 she founded the American Birth Control League 
which later became the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. </p>

<p>1925 - Sanger's second husband financed the first manufacturing of 
the diaphragm in the U.S.</p>

<p>1950 - The U.S. population was 150 million.</p>

<p>1954 - The Hugh Moore Fund first used the term "population bomb" on 
their published pamphlet. He was a philanthropist from Pennsylvania. His
 mantra was "Your cause is a lost cause unless you support family 
planning."</p>

<p>1960 - The "pill" was invented and became available to women for 
contraception.</p>

<p>1965 - Congress passed the Immigration and Nationality Act, ending 
four decades of restricted immigration. This law, while removing limits 
based on country of origin, included provisions for family 
reunification, opening the door to "chain migration."</p>

<p>1965 - The U.S. Supreme Court decision of Buxton and Griswold vs. 
Conn. legalized birth control for married couples offering "privacy of 
the bedroom."</p>

<p>1967 - U.S. population reached 200 million.</p>

<p>1968 - The Population Bomb, by Paul R. Ehrlich was published by the 
Sierra Club. This book laid the foundation for widespread concern about 
population growth among environmentalists and others that followed in 
the early years of the 1970's.</p>

<p>1968 - The organization Zero Population Growth (ZPG) was formed. 
There were dozens of local chapters throughout the country. ZPG later 
became Population Connection, with a focus on world population.</p>

<p>1970 - Earth Day was declared with population growth a major issue on
 the agenda. Dr. Mary Steichen Calderon, past medical director of the 
PPFA, established the Sex, Information and Education Council (SIECUS).</p>

<p>1972 - The Commission on Population and the American Future report, 
chaired by John D. Rockefeller III, stated "We have looked for, and have
 not found, any convincing economic argument for continued population 
growth. The health of our economy does not depend upon it, nor does the 
vitality of business, nor the welfare of the average person." President 
Richard Nixon supported this and the National Security Study Memorandum 
200 on population, both of which were defeated by Congress.</p>

<p>1972 - The Limits to Growth, is published by the Club of Rome. The 
book modeled the consequences of a rapidly growing population and finite
 resource supplies. The book was updated in 1993 and in 2004 under the 
name Limits to Growth: The 30-Year Update. In 1996 one of the authors, 
Donella Meadows, founded the Sustainability Institute in Hartland, Vt.</p>

<p>1973 - The U.S. Supreme Court decision Roe vs. Wade affirmed a 
women's the right to abortion.

US Ohio;: Women in Their 20s Lead Rise in Out-of-Wedlock Births.
</h4>
<span class="smallfont">

Associated Press</span>
<p>
Up to 40% of last year's births among unmarried women, up from 29% in 
1990. The birth rate among teens declined in 2006 to the lowest level on
 record. The increase has been led by women in their late 20s who have 
delayed marriage or are in live-in relationships. Behind are women in 
their 30s and 40s with college degrees and careers. </p>

<p>Appropriate partners may not be available due to death or

The United States at 300 Million.
</a></h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
October 03, 2006 &nbsp;
</span>
<p>
The US is set to become the third country after China and India to have 
300 million people. Within another 37 years, we are projected to pass 
400 million.
Natural increase drives nearly 60% population growth annually. 
International immigration accounts for about 40%. One of the most 
significant trends has been the shift of the population west and south. 
Between 1970 and 2000, the population share in the South and West rose 
from 48% to 58%. People are moving farther from central cities and their
 inner suburbs, pushing into woodlands and farmland.</p>

<p>The percent of the total population living in the suburbs of 
metropolitan areas grew from 38% to 50% between 1970 and 2000, while 
those living in central cities stayed at around 30%. People are 
concerned about crowding.</p>

<p>One-person households are more than twice as common as those of five 
people or more at more than 26% of the total. Young adults are moving 
out on their own. Older people who are divorced or widowed often choose 
to live alone.</p>

<p>Many forces underlie these changes. The age at first marriage has 
risen from 23 to 27 for men and from 21 to 26 for women. Increasing 
levels of women's education give women more options for independence 
outside marriage.</p>

<p>Children are moving back home after college. Saddled with school 
loans, many overcome any reservations they might have had to returning 
to the nest.</p>

<p>Between 1970 and 2004, the share of women in the labor force rose 
from 43% to 59%. The array of occupations include far more than the 
traditional options. Economic forces exerted pressure on families until 
it was hard for one-income families to get by. </p>

<p>Experts believe the current Social Security system will not be able 
to cover the payments promised to retirees after 2030. Of Americans ages
 25 and older the share who finished high school soared from 55% to 85% 
between 1970 and 2004. Now more applicants are expected to have a 
college degree. The number of foreign-born people in the US has reached 
more than 35 million. But at 12% of the population, the share is lower 
than it was between 1860 and 1920, when it ranged to 15%.</p>

<p>The largest share of immigrants to the US still comes from Latin 
America, and from Mexico in particular.</p>

<p>Many are not authorized to be here. Recent estimates peg the number 
of unauthorized migrants at 11.5 million, with more than one-half from 
Mexico.</p>

<p>Immigrants are fueling the growth in the number of ethnic minorities.
 One-fifth of all children under age 18 are either foreign-born or in a 
family where at least one parent was foreign-born. Today, almost half of
 all children under age 5 are members of a racial or ethnic minority. 
And if current trends persist, that share will increase.</p>

<p>These trends could have an impact on the US. Since 1974, the under 
age 18 have been more likely to live below the poverty line than other 
age groups. In 2005, 18% of the young lived in poverty, compared with 
10% of people 65 and over and 11% ages 18 to 64. Members of racial or 
ethnic minorities are more likely to live in poverty, with blacks the 
most likely 34%, Hispanics 28% and whites 14%.</p>

<p>If we don't address these age and race differences in poverty and 
well-being, today's children may be less able or willing to support the 
predominantly white when they reach adulthood.

U.S. Population Growth and Its Effects on Our Environment Must Be 
Addressed, Experts Say.
</a></h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
August 06, 2006 &nbsp;
San Diego Union Tribune</span>
<p>
The top-priority campaigns of the nation's big environmental groups 
emphasize animals, pollution and global warming.</p>

<p>What's missing are initiatives that tackle U.S. population growth.</p>

<p>The environmental establishment has abandoned talking about the 
nation's growing populace, particularly as it relates to immigration. 
The debate centers on economics and national security.</p>

<p>The US population has nearly doubled since 1950, and is expected to 
hit 300 million in October.</p>

<p>The link between population and the country's environmental capacity,
 its water supply, farmland, fisheries and other natural resources, is 
getting more attention from groups that aren't among the names in 
environmentalism.</p>

<p>The scientific data shows that the U.S. is reaching many of the 
nation's ecological limits, and that many are linked to population 
trends. It's a shame that environmentalists haven't found a way to get 
involved in a prominent way. 
Countries in Europe, with Russia and Japan, have shrinking populations 
because births aren't keeping pace with deaths. </p>

<p>America's relatively high population growth and high rates of 
consumption and pollution make result in the largest environmental 
impact per capita.</p>

<p>Americans occupy about 20% more developed land per capita for 
housing, schools, shopping, roads and other uses than they did 20 years 
ago, partly because the average number of people per household has 
dropped while the average size of homes has swelled. About 40% of the 
nation's rivers and 46% of its lakes are too polluted for fishing and 
swimming. Wetlands are shrinking by 100,000 acres a year, mainly because
 of development.</p>

<p>More than half the U.S. population lives within 50 miles of the 
coast, and can damage seaside ecosystems.</p>

<p>There's no universally accepted estimate of how many people the 
nation can accommodate.</p>

<p>The number is ultimately a question of balancing quality and 
quantity.</p>

<p>Technological advances that help clean the air, conserve water and 
grow more food on less farmland have helped to mitigate or delay 
predicted population-induced disasters.</p>

<p>Last year, one of every five immigrants worldwide lived in the United
 States. The National Audubon Society supports international family 
planning while taking no position on U.S. immigration. Greenpeace and 
the Natural Resources Defense Council largely stay out of domestic 
immigration issues, though neither explain why.</p>

<p>Sorting out the ecological costs and benefits of immigration and 
population growth can be enormously complex and has led some 
environmentalists to say their groups should stick with saving species, 
curbing pollution and preserving open space.</p>

<p>Aggressively advocating birth control or abortion rights could 
alienate church groups. The U.S. population grew by 14.9 million between
 April 2000 and July 2005. Immigration accounted for more than 42%.</p>

<p>Immigrants also play a key role in population growth once they arrive
 in the United tates.</p>

<p>A 2005 report found that there was an annual average of 84 births per
 1,000 foreign-born women in the U.S., compared with 57 births per 1,000
 native U.S. women.</p>

<p>The US has 12 million unauthorized immigrants. About 3 million of 
them, mostly from Mexico, live in California.

China: And Why Not a Baby Girl.
</h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
November 3, 2010 &nbsp;
InterPress Service</span>
<p>
Affluent urban couples in China are starting to think about having a 
second baby, hoping it is a girl.</p>

<p>Some are concerned that their first child will move away when he 
grows up, and a daughter can stay and take care of them. </p>

<p>An example given of such a couple are a woman and her husband who  
own a software company in Beijing that earns the couple about 500,000 
yuan (74,828 U.S. dollars) a year - enough to afford circumventing the 
one-child policy. Under this policy, couples need to pay a fine, based 
on families' annual income, that has been reported to range from 45,000 
dollars to more than 100,000 dollars. </p>

<p>The couple thought it was too expensive to raise a boy, especially in
 big cities like Beijing and Shanghai. "We have to buy him an apartment 
at least.  Otherwise it will be difficult for him to find a girlfriend."</p>

<p>In China, where a historical preference for boys has led to a 
dramatic gender imbalance, attitudes about having girls are beginning to
 change in urban areas. According to a 2009 survey of 3,500 prospective 
parents in Shanghai, 15 percent of those interviewed wanted a baby 
daughter compared to 12 percent who wanted a baby boy. The rest had no 
preference. </p>

<p>China's gender imbalance has reached dangerous levels. The attitude 
that girls cannot accomplish as much as boys is becoming outdated. 
"Girls can also inherit a family business."  "They can be as able as 
men." </p>

<p>A booming economy in the last decade has created more opportunities 
for woman, particularly in the cities.  Rising incomes have rendered 
moot the traditional reasons for wanting a boy - namely that a boy will 
earn more money to support his parents in old age. </p>

<p>In 2005, the last year for which data is available, there were 119 
boys born for every 100 girls. In some areas, the ratio was as high as 
130 males for every 100 females. </p>

<p>In rural areas preference for boys has led to a number of selective 
abortion, prostitution and human trafficking. China has a surplus of 
some 32 million boys. </p>

<p>South Korea has had a shift in gender preference in the last 20 
years. In 2006, Korea's gender ratio was 107.4 boys born for every 100 
girls, down from a peak of 116.5 boys to every 100 girls in 1990, 
according to a 2007 World Bank study. (Demographers consider a 105 to 
100 ratio
normal). </p>

<p>Major shifts in Korea's economy created opportunities for women in 
the work force, changing long- held attitudes toward women?s role in 
society.</p>

<p>A study in 2010 by the government-supported Chinese Academy of Social
 Sciences named the gender imbalance among newborns - not overpopulation
 - the country's most serious demographic problem.</p>

<p>The study attributed the gender imbalance to China's three-decade-old
 one-child policy and to a poor social security system.</p>

<p>"The chance of getting married will be rare if a man is more than 40 
years old in the countryside. They will be more dependent on social 
security as they age and have fewer household resources to rely on," 
another researcher said. Abductions and trafficking of women were 
"rampant" in areas with too many men. </p>

<p>China has made great strides in terms of gender equality. There are a
 growing number of women in government administrative positions, 
legislation on gender equality continues to rise and there are more 
women receiving education at high levels.

Incredible Shrinking US Family.
</h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
December 02, 2004 &nbsp;
Monitor, The(Uganda)</span>
<p>
Over the last several decades the size of US families has shrunk. The 
percentage of households containing five or more people has fallen by 
half and the number of single and two-person households has soared. 
Compared to the middle of the 20th century, marriage is not a universal 
status of adulthood. Disney films have depicted a number of 
untraditional family groups but the model of three children living with 
both their natural parents, is retro today. In 1970, 21% of households 
had five or more people, today it has dropped to 10% while households 
with one or two people increased from 46% to 60%. The number of people 
per household decreased from 3.14 to 2.57. The proportion of young, 
never-married singles has increased, particularly women 30 to 34 which 
has tripled since 1970. The reduced fertility is the result of the 
increase in the percentage of women who work and the rising expense of 
raising children. Parents are more concerned with putting effort into 
the raising of each child and unlike European societies, the US has 
limited government support for families. Big families  may be becoming 
the province of the upper classes who can afford them. The US has an 
estimated 5.5 million stay-at-home parents, and of these, 5.4 million 
are women. There are only 98,000 stay-at-home dads.

US Life Expectancy at All-time High, but Infant Deaths Up - Cdc.
</h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
February 12, 2004 &nbsp;
Push newsfeed</span>
<p>
Life expectancy for 2002 reached 77.4 years, up from 77.2 in 2001. 
Infant mortality increased from 6.8 deaths per 1,000 in 2001 to 7.0 per 
1,000 in 2002. In 2002, there were four million births and 27,977 infant
 deaths. The rise was due to an increase in infant deaths of less than 
28 weeks old, particularly infants who died within the first week of 
life. The three major causes were birth defects, premature birth low 
birth weight, and maternal complications. SIDs declined from 2001 to 
2002. The US mortality rate dropped by 855 across all ethnic groups 
except native Americans and non-Hispanic white females, whose death 
rates remained unchanged. Homicides dropped by 17% from 2001, although 
that figure was distorted by the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. 
Among leading causes of death, heart disease dropped 3%, stroke nearly 
3%, accidents and unintentional injuries, nearly 2% and cancer, 1%. 
Death from HIV/AIDS, dropped 2%. HIV mortality has decreased 70% since 
1995, but remains the fifth leading cause of death from people ages 
25-44.

 that this may lead to an increase in the trafficking of women.

Bring on the Baby Boom.
</a></h4>
<span class="smallfont">

USA Today</span>
<p>
Judging by magazine stories on celebrity bumps, babies dominate pop 
culture these days. In 2007, the total fertility rate in the USA hit 
2.12 births per woman, a bit higher than 2006, and much higher than the 
1.74 in 1976.</p>

<p>The U.S. is one of the few developed countries to have a fertility 
rate above replacement level. Demographers debate the reasons, but 
there's a case to be made that not only is a high birthrate a good sign,
 we should be hoping it rises at least a bit more.</p>

<p>Surveying childbearing across the developed world, America is a 
fecund outlier. Demographers have many theories for our exceptionality. 
The USA has a high teen pregnancy rate and many unplanned pregnancies.</p>

<p>Across the developed world, many women say they want two kids. In the
 U.S., the average woman is likely to sometimes go over. </p>

<p>Compared with Japan's 1.2 rate, getting families to the desired two 
kids is noteworthy. Our fertility rate rose 22% from 1976 to 2007, as 
women's workforce participation rates rose an equal amount. In other 
words, women think they can manage jobs and families. More professional 
and educated women who 10-15 years ago felt like 'I can only handle one 
child' say 'I can have a second.' </p>

<p>Environmentalists fret that high birthrates strain the planet; a 3.8 
would mean a billion-plus Americans within two generations. A rate of 
2.1-2.5 keeps us growing manageably, and there's an argument for hoping 
it climbs within that range.</p>

<p>With fewer workers supporting an aging population, Social Security, 
for instance, will exhaust its trust fund about 2041.</p>

<p>A higher birthrate could ease that. The economic growth a rising 
population will shrink our debt to a more manageable percentage of GDP.

<div class="comment">Karen Gaia says: To respond to these wild claims, 
send an email to: editor@usatoday.com.   Include your full name, address

Submissions are edited for length (250 words or less), accuracy and

Vanderkam's column. ('Bring on the Baby Boom') misses the point.

Large numbers of women and teens are reporting unintended or unwanted 
pregnancies, particularly now that some many have experienced 
joblessness and lowered wages. Rather than promoting more babies, we 
should be expanding comprehensive sex education in the schools and 
increasing eligibility under Medicaid for family planning services.

An increase in fertility to 2.4 or 2.5 children per women, combined with
 projected immigration trends, could easily push U.S. population over 
the 1 billion mark by the end of the century.


There are not enough natural resources to sustain a projected population
 of 9.2 billion. Why should we add more Americans to this number, 
particularly a child born in America has a much larger 'ecological 
footprint' than a child born in a developing country. Americans already 
account for about 25 percent of the world's consumption of scarce 
resources, like oil, and we emit at least 20 percent of all greenhouse 
gases. 

In a world of rising food prices, growing water scarcity, climate 
change, and projected energy shortfalls, population growth rates - 
particularly in the U.S. - pose far greater risks to the environment and
 economic well-being than any benefit that would be derived by shoring 
up the fiscal solvency of Social Security.

Using what amounts to a Ponzi scheme to attempt to fix Social Security 
makes no sense. When the additional babies being promoted by Laura 
Vanderkam grow up, it will be in a poorer America due to depletion of 
natural resources by our growing population. America rose economically 
on the oil boom. This boom will soon bust. Already in urbanized areas of
 the world, joblessness is becoming a large problem. Will there be jobs 
for the next generation of baby boomers? And who will support them when 
they become old?</div>

<h4>

U.S.: Shaky Economy Means 'Bye-Bye Baby' for Some.
</h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
January 15, 2009 &nbsp;
MSNBC.com</span>
<p>
The economy is a worry for many Americans, with 80% saying they feel 
stress about their personal finances. Many have decided the time isn't 
right to have a child. There was a dramatic decline in fertility rates 
following the Great Depression in the 1930s.</p>

<p>In each year after the country's last four recessions, general 
fertility rates dipped slightly. For example, following the 1980-1982 
recession, the fertility rate [birth rate] fell from 68.4 in 1980 to 
65.7 in 1983.</p>

<p>How far the birth rate falls depends on how severe and long this 
financial crunch turns out to be. The U.S. birth rate has been at 
replacement levels for the past three decades, which, plus immigration, 
ensures the population remains robust.</p>

<p>The No. 1 thing in this calendar year is postponement, But if this 
translated into a long-term fertility drop, it would be a big deal. Some
 clinics around the country are seeing signs of a financially driven 
baby chill.</p>

<p>In vitro fertilization increased about 17% in 2008 over the prior 
year, and consults for new IVF patients seem to be holding steady. A 
middle-class family making more than $77,100 will spend nearly $300,000 
raising a child from birth to age 17, not taking account of college 
tuition or inflation.</p>

<p>For some families, postponing may mean just delaying a few months. 
For others, it could mean they never have children, due to age-related 
declines in fertility.

<h4>

Teen Birth Rates Up in 26 States.
</h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
January 07, 2009 &nbsp;
USA Today</span>
<p>
There are increases in the number of teens having births and the rate at
 which they are having births. </p>

<p>The data shows significant increases for 2006. In the two previous 
years only one state in each year had a significant increase.</p>

<p>In 2006, the general fertility rate hit its highest level since 1971.
 New data gives credence to the idea that the downturn in birth rates is
 over. The highest teen birth rates are Mississippi with 68.4 per 1,000,
 followed by New Mexico, with 64.1 and Texas, with 63.1. The lowest 
rates are in New Hampshire with 18.7 per 1,000, Vermont, with 20.8 per 
1,000, and Massachusetts, with 21.3 per 1,000.</p>

<p>Some blame a more sexualized culture and greater acceptance of births
 to unmarried women. Others say abstinence-only and a de-emphasis on 
birth control may play a part.</p>

<p>The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy claims 
that abortion is driving higher teen birth rates and suggests that 
increases in high-profile unmarried births in Hollywood, movies and even
 politics is a factor for impressionable teens.</p>

<p>The new data reflects the first decline since 1968 in the average age
 of first-time mothers, from 25.2 years in 2005 to 25 in 2006.

<h4>

Against the Trend, U.S. Births Way Up.
</h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
January 16, 2008 &nbsp;
Associated Press Online</span>
<p>
The US is reporting the largest number of children born in 45 years. The
 nearly 4.3 million births in 2006 were mostly due to a bigger 
population, especially  Hispanics. That group accounted for nearly 
one-quarter of all U.S. births. Data shows that the US has a higher 
fertility rate than Europe, Australia, Canada and Japan.</p>

<p>Experts believe the reasons are: a decline in contraceptive use, a 
drop in access to abortion, poor education and poverty. </p>

<p>Hispanics have fertility rates about 40% higher than the U.S. 
overall. Americans, especially those in middle America, view children 
more favorably than other Westernized countries. </p>

<p>Demographers say it is too soon to know if the sudden increase in 
births is the start of a trend. </p>

<p>To many economists and policymakers, the increase in births is good 
news. Countries with much lower rates  face future labor shortages and 
eroding tax bases as they fail to reproduce enough to take care of their
 aging elders. </p>

<p>But the higher fertility rate isn't all good. The CDC reported that 
America's teen birth rate rose for the first time in 15 years. </p>

<p>Births are more common in nearly every age and racial or ethnic 
group. Total births jumped 3% in 2006, the largest single-year increase 
since 1989. The recent birth numbers are a result of many women having a
 couple of kids each, rather than a smaller number of mothers, each 
bearing several children. </p>

<p>The 2006 fertility rate of 2.1 children is the highest level since 
1971. The fertility rate among Hispanics 3 children per woman has been a
 major contributor. The high rate probably reflects cultural attitudes 
toward childbirth developed in other countries. Fertility rates average 
2.7 in Central America and 2.4 in South America. </p>

<p>Fertility rates often rise among immigrants. The rate among 
Mexican-born women in the U.S. is 3.2, but the overall rate for Mexico 
is just 2.4. </p>

<p>Some complain that many illegal immigrants come here purposely to 
have children. 
"The child is an automatic American citizen, thus entitled to all 
benefits of American citizens."</p>

<p>Fertility rates were also relatively high for other racial and ethnic
 groups. The rate rose to 2.1 for blacks and nearly 1.9 for non-Hispanic
 whites in 2006. </p>

<p>Fertility levels tend to decline as women become better educated and 
gain career opportunities. Experts say those factors, along with the 
legalization of abortion and the expansion of contraception options, 
explain why the U.S. fertility rate dropped to 1.7 in 1976. The 
fertility rate climbed to 2 in 1989 and has hovered around that mark 
since.</p>

<p>Other factors include: declines in contraceptive use here; limited 
access to abortion in some states; and opportunities for mothers to 
return to work. It is more common for American women to have babies out 
of wedlock and more common for couples to go forward with unwanted 
pregnancies. New England's fertility rates are more like Northern 
Europe's. American women in the Midwest, South and certain mountain 
states tend to have more children. </p>

<p>The influence of religions in those latter regions is an important 
factor.

The nation's teen birth rate has risen for the first time in 14 years. 
The birth rate had been dropping since 1991, but government 
statisticians said  it jumped 3% from 2005 to 2006.</p>

<p>For 2006 births to unmarried mothers hit a new record high, and the 
overall birth rate has climbed to its highest level since 1971.</p>

<p>The teen increase was based on the 15-19 age group, which accounted 
for about 99% of the more than 440,000 births to teens in 2006.</p>

<p>The rate rose to 41.9 live births per 1,000 females in that age 
group, up from 40.5 in 2005.

U.S.;: How Many People is Too Many?.

Alternet</span>
<p>
This year, the USA will hit 300 million inhabitants and 400 million in 
less than 40 years.</p>

<p>When people don't have the means and information to control their 
fertility, the results are that you can't go a week without seeing 
evidence of overpopulation, choked highways, crowded classrooms. We have
 to maintain not having living space and forests, farms, wetlands, etc.</p>

<p>One-third of all pregnancies in this country are unintended. Yet 
we're wasting millions on abstinence programs that have been shown never
 to work. Abstinence proponents want to punish people who act, in their 
view, immorally. </p>

<p>Current attacks on birth control are as much about making political 
hay as making babies. </p>

<p>They see access to contraception within marriage as a negative 
influence: it gives easy access to adultery and therefore has reduced 
faithfulness in marriage. 
A professor at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary said "We've got
 room. Don't let the fear of overcrowding discourage you, the issue is 
what the Lord wants for them."</p>

<p>Jennifer Shawne has published her book "Baby Not on Board: A 
Celebration of Life Without Kids" last year and says that it's not just 
religious conservatives who try to convince her of her duty to have 
children. She points out the unsupported assumption that political and 
cultural attitudes are inherited traits.</p>

<p>The Oakland-based think tank Redefining Progress estimated that this 
nation's level of consumption and waste generation requires 269 global 
acres per person, almost nine times the footprint of the average in 
China and more than 22 times that of the average Indian or Pakistani.</p>

<p>From the planet's point of view, the birth of a single American child
 has the potential impact of 10 births in those countries.</p>

<p>What would 400 million Americans look like?</p>

<p>Pat Buchanan argued that our nation's existence is threatened by 
insufficient enthusiasm for childbearing  and growing immigration from 
Mexico. Buchanan urged a return to large, patriarchal families as a way 
of outstripping the immigrant population.</p>

<p>Negative Population Growth (NPG), is a U.S. population of 150 million
 and advocates the two-child family and curtailment of resource 
consumption, but now spends most of its energy on immigration issues.</p>

<p>Working for reproductive rights and smaller families without forceful
 action on immigration is doomed to fail.</p>

<p>"If not for immigration, we already would have stabilized the U.S. 
population. Our problem is immigration. It's easy for one person to 
bring in his sisters, brothers, parents. And immigrants have more 
children. Pretty quickly, one immigrant can really amount to 12."</p>

<p>Can we find ways of viewing immigration that lead to a less cruel 
course of action?</p>

<p>What is really going on is capitalism operating normally. Employers 
gain. Native workers lose. Immigrants lose too. Both groups lose because
 they are not united.</p>

<p>If it's hard to predict how many of us there will be, it's even 
tougher to know who we'll be. Jennifer Shawne said, "This culture, is 
constantly evolving. I'm more interested in seeing how it changes in the
 future than in preserving it as it is or was."

U.S.: Simple Intervention May Reduce Reproductive Coercion.
</a></h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
August 30, 2010 &nbsp;
RH Reality Check (U.S.)</span>
<p>
A new pilot study finds that a simple intervention--asking women 
visiting family planning clinics about sexual violence and coercion--can
 dramatically reduce the incidence of a form of intimate-partner 
violence known as reproductive coercion.</p>

<p>Reproductive coercion can involve various actions by abusive spouses 
or partners. One example is pregnancy coercion, in which partners 
verbally pressure women to become pregnant. Another is birth-control 
sabotage, in which a partner secretly or overtly damages condoms, throws
 away or prevents her from using birth control pills or uses other means
 to force a woman to become pregnant. Intimate partner violence, 
including pregnancy coercion, is a widespread public health problem, 
both in the United States and globally.</p>

<p>Researchers specifically asked young women whether their partners had
 attempted to force them to become pregnant. The study found that young 
women who recently experienced partner violence had a 70% reduction in 
the odds that they would continue to experience pregnancy coercion 
following the questioning. The study participants also were 60% more 
likely to report ending a relationship with a partner because they felt 
unsafe or the relationship felt unhealthy.</p>

<p>This pilot study was focused on how we might better identify 
intimate-partner violence and reproductive coercion in clinical settings
 and offer women specific strategies to reduce their risk of an unwanted
 pregnancy and increase their safety.</p>

<p>The intervention was designed collaboratively with the Family 
Violence Prevention Fund and reproductive health experts.</p>

<p>While the odds of pregnancy coercion dropped by 70% for women who 
received the intervention, there was no significant change in the odds 
of pregnancy coercion for women who had not reported experiencing 
intimate-partner violence within the past three months, or for women who
 did not receive the intervention. However, awareness of 
intimate-partner violence-related resources increased in both the 
intervention group and the control group, the authors said.</p>

<p>Given the current critical need for effective low-cost unintended- 
and teen-pregnancy prevention, it is extremely encouraging that this 
combination of screening for reproductive coercion and abuse and 
providing simple educational information significantly reduced women?s 
pregnancy coercion.

Contraceptive Pill First Sold in U.S. 50 Years Ago.
</h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
August 18, 2010 &nbsp;
Lubbock Avalanche-Journal (Texas)</span>
<p>
50 years ago today, the first contraceptive pill, called Evonid was 
introduced in the U.S. </p>

<p>In 1960, when the pill was introduced, few women worked outside the 
home, families were large and surprises were expected. For many women, 
having sex came with the fear of an unwanted pregnancy. </p>

<p>Then, unmarried women could rarely buy Evonid, and prescriptions for 
the pill were made out to the husband.</p>

<p>In 1960, the average U.S. birthrate was 3.6 children; by 1980 that 
number had dropped to below two. </p>

<p>Before the pill, people were using abortion as a form of birth 
control</p>

<p>The pill allowed a woman to plan her family, space out her 
pregnancies and improved her health.</p>

<p>In 1965, 26.2 million women went to work; by 2008, the number had 
risen to 71.8 million, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. </p>

<p>The pill also uncoupled sex and reproduction and started a 
revolution.</p>

<p>The pill also protected from ovarian cancer, endometriosis, and 
polycystic ovary syndrome, the later which interferes with the ability 
to have children.  </p>

<p>By 1965, the pill was available nationwide and was the most popular 
reversible form of birth control. Today, almost 20% of the 60% of women 
using birth control take the pill. This is followed by female 
sterilization - 16%, condoms - 11%, and male sterilization - 6%.</p>

<p>Lower hormone doses allowed researchers to create implants and skin 
patches.  </p>

<p>"From a public perception, it has allowed women to be sexually active
 maybe before they should," Thornton said. "We encourage women to put 
off sexual activity for as long as they can.

When Teen Pregnancy is No Accident; New Studies Suggest That Many 
Partners of Young Women Are Coercing Pregnancy, Or Sabotaging Attempts 
at Prevention.
</h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
May 27, 2010 &nbsp;
NPR</span>
<p>
Some boyfriends of teen girls have been known to hide their birth 
control pills, along with beating them or locking them in a closet if 
they find the pills in their possession.</p>

<p>Other boyfriends insist on an abortion of their girl friend becomes 
pregnant, continuously harrassing the girl if she continues the 
pregnancy.</p>

<p>Expert researchers on dating violence and unintended pregnancy say 
such stories are all too common. Two new studies have shown the striking
 frequency with which young men who try to force their partners to get 
pregnant, not to settle down as family men but rather to exert control. 
This control may include attempts to force both pregnancy and abortion, 
even in the same relationship. This phenomenon is called "reproductive 
coercion," in which abusive partners subject young women already at risk
 of violence to the additional health risks of pregnancy and sexually 
transmitted infections. </p>

<p>We must now understand not only who's forcing whom to get pregnant 
but also the meaning and causes of "unwanted" pregnancy. "If we are 
serious about stopping unplanned pregnancy in this country, we simply 
must address the sexual violence and reproductive control that often 
cause it," says Esta Soler, president of the Family Violence Prevention 
Fund, which has been a leading advocate on the issue.</p>

<p>In a study of women aged 18-49 with a history of intimate partner 
violence, 74% reported having experienced some form of reproductive 
control, including forced unprotected intercourse, failure to withdraw 
as promised or sabotaging of condoms, and threats of violence if they 
had an abortion. </p>

<p>The study authors recommend that service providers in women's health 
clinics offer birth control (such as IUDs) that can be hidden from 
partners if reproductive coercion is suspected.</p>

<p>In a study of 1,300 16-29 year old women, "Pregnancy Coercion, 
Intimate Partner Violence and Unintended Pregnancy," published in the 
January issue of the journal Contraception. Women seeking services at 
five different Northern
California reproductive health clinics were surveyed. Among those who 
had experienced intercourse, 53% ssid they'd experienced physical or 
sexual violence from a partner, and 20% said they had experienced 
pregnancy coercion; 15% said they experienced birth control sabotage, 
including hiding or flushing birth control pills down the toilet, 
intentional breaking of condoms and removing contraceptive rings or 
patches. </p>

<p>In January, the Guttmacher Institute reported that between 2005 and 
2006 the pregnancy rate among girls ages 15 to 19 had jumped for the 
first time since 1990, by a factor of 3%. "There are a multitude of 
reasons for the recent increase in teen pregnancy," ... "Reproductive 
coercion may be one piece of the puzzle."
Recent research demonstrates that there's a clear need for relationship 
violence prevention to be integrated into pregnancy prevention and 
sexual health curricula. Preventing unwanted pregnancy appears to be 
about more than making contraception available.</p>

<p>"It's imperative that we teach kids comprehensive sex ed that 
includes awareness of violence and coercion. The more we can help them 
understand what constitutes a good relationship and where you go for 
help when something's not good, the more they have a fighting chance," 
says Debra Hauser, executive vice president of Advocates For Youth.</p>

<p>In 2009 President Obama signed into law a $114.5 million teen 
pregnancy prevention initiative based on medically accurate, 
research-based information. $75 million is reserved for programming 
already proven effective, and at least $25 million is earmarked for 
research and testing of innovative new approaches.</p>

<p>The Family Violence Prevention Fund has just launched a $3 million 
violence-prevention initiative called Project Connect, designed to find 
new ways to identify and respond to domestic and sexual violence, 
including reproductive coercion. Working with ten state health 
departments and violence-prevention advocacy groups nationwide, the fund
 will train staff at family planning, adolescent health, home visitation
 and other maternal child health programs to understand domestic 
violence and reproductive coercion so that they recognize it when they 
see it and know how to help.

U.S.: As the Pill Turns 50, Family Planning Too Costly for Many.
</h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
May 9, 2010 &nbsp;
macon.com</span>
<p>
On May 9, 1960, the FDA approved oral contraceptives,changing the lives 
of women, giving them the choice of when and how to have children.</p>

<p>But after 50 years, millions of the country's poorest women aren't 
sharing in the empowerment. 59% of women who need subsidized family 
planning in the U.S. aren't receiving care, according to a 2006 report 
from the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit organization that works to 
advance reproductive health.</p>

<p>In 2006, before unemployment skyrocketed and the country sank into a 
recession, the national unemployment rate was 4.7%; today it is around 
9.7%. In 2006, 17.5 million women of reproductive age needed assistance 
paying for contraception.</p>

<p>The National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association, 
which represents about 90% of federally funded family-planning clinics, 
predicts today's numbers are going to be worse. More women are either 
turning to Medicaid, going to less effective methods, or engaging in 
risky behavior.</p>

<p>States are struggling to find room in their budgets for birth 
control.</p>

<p>State-based options range from private-public partnerships, with 
providers such as Planned Parenthood, to community health centers and 
private physicians. The most common source of funding for subsidized and
 no-cost birth control is Medicaid, according to Guttmacher.</p>

<p>California's Family PACT plan has been sucessfully providing free 
family-planning services to women who earn less than 200% of the 
national poverty level, which is about $22,000 for a single woman. But 
California has become one of the most financially unstable states. 
California health department's Office of Family Planning is currently 
serving about 1.8 million Californians.</p>

<p>"The cost of the program benefit is about $311 per year per client, 
but when we did our last survey in 2002, we were saving the state and 
federal government nearly a billion dollars every two years."</p>

<p>The savings are realized by preventing pregnancies in women who would
 need financial assistance with prenatal, birthing and postnatal care 
and, in some instances, treatment for pregnancy complications.</p>

<p>California's system is intended to reduce or eliminate as many 
barriers to accessing assistance as possible. Not only is its income 
threshold one of the highest in the country, women also are enrolled and
 eligible for services on the same day. They can go to walk-in clinics 
and walk out with their contraceptives.</p>

<p>But the Guttmacher Institute estimates that only 55% of the women who
 need services in California are receiving them.</p>

<p>In North Carolina, only 35% of the women who need help in obtaining 
birth control receive it.</p>

<p>"The challenge around rural areas is funding and confidentiality," 
according to Planned Parenthood of Central North Carolina.</p>

<p>"You're likely to know someone who is working in your health 
department. For many people, the fear of being seen or known will 
prevent them from going to get services."</p>

<p>North Carolina, like California, is one of the 28 states that have 
waivers that allow them to use federal Medicaid funds to offset the cost
 of family planning. However, for the past 15 years the state has had an
 abstinence-only sex-education system. A comprehensive sex-education 
plan that will go into effect this fall.</p>

<p>Untangling family-planning preventive measures from discussions of 
abortion was a key step, Johnson said. If the two issues become linked 
and abortion fights grab headlines, family planning gets lost in the 
outcry.</p>

<p>"I think more and more Republicans are certainly coming around to 
saying that we can separate prevention and planning from abortion," said
 Kellie Ferguson, the executive director of the Republican Majority for 
Choice, an organization that supports reproductive rights.</p>

<p>"Whether you're pro- or anti-choice, we all want to see the rate and 
need for abortion to go down."

US California: Profile of a Teen Success Participant.
</h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
March 29, 2010 &nbsp;
Planned Parenthood Mar Monte</span>
<p>
Rebecca became pregnant when she was just 12 years old, and gave birth 
to a daughter at age 13. The father of her baby was only 13.</p>

<p>Rebecca, now 16, felt isolated during the first months of the 
pregnancy because her family urged her to have an abortion. But she was 
determined to see the pregnancy through. "In my heart I felt I could 
take care of my daughter even though I couldn't be there financially. I 
could be there physically and emotionally."</p>

<p>When her daughter was 14 months old, Rebecca was referred to Planned 
Parenthood's Teen Success program, designed to motivate pregnant and 
parenting teen mothers to maintain their family size and finish their 
education.</p>

<p>At first, Rebecca feared being judged, and was reluctant to go to the
 meetings. But after the first session and hearing other young girls' 
stories, she was relieved and decided to come back the following week. 
Now, after 3-1/2 years, she has been faithfully attending weekly Teen 
Success meetings.</p>

<p>She said the program has helped her with goals. For example, she was 
very self-conscious about being overweight after her pregnancy. The Teen
 Success facilitator reminded Rebecca could come to group meetings 
without being judged. She went on a diet and lost 50 pounds, with fellow
 Teen Success moms applauding her new healthy eating habits and 
trimmed-down shape.</p>

<p>"Teen Success is real encouraging," she said. "They make you feel 
like you don't want to give up on anything - staying in school, being a 
parent, maintaining your family size or getting a job.

US California: Domestic Abuse May Affect Reproductive Freedom.
</h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
January 25, 2010 &nbsp;
Medpage Today</span>
<p>
In abusive relationships, some women are sabotaged into becoming 
pregnant, by men poking holes in condoms and flushing birth control 
pills down the toilet, for example.</p>

<p>In a study by Elizabeth Miller, MD, of the University of California 
Davis, and colleagues of 1,278 women ages 16 to 29 treated at five 
family clinics across northern California, about 20% of women said that 
their partner tried to coerce them into having a child. The results were
 reported in the online journal 'Contraception'.</p>

<p>More than half of the women surveyed reported physical or sexual 
partner violence and a third of those also reported pregnancy coercion 
or birth control sabotage.</p>

<p>Both pregnancy coercion and birth control sabotage were separately 
associated with unintended pregnancy, and the two together nearly 
doubled a woman's odds of unintended pregnancy.</p>

<p>Men wanted their partners to have children for various reasons: to 
leave a legacy, a desire for attachment, having absolute control over 
her body, or to make them dependent on their partner. There have been 
cases where a young mother who has a child with another partner will be 
forced by her new boyfriend to have another baby with him.</p>

<p>Key strategies include advising women about "invisible" forms of 
birth control such as injectable and intrauterine contraceptives, as 
well as easy access to emergency contraception. "If we can identify that
 reproductive control is going on," Miller said, "we can offer the woman
 methods for birth control that the partner can't mess with."</p>

<p>Physicians and counsellors should talk about women's empowerment with
 regard to reproduction during reproductive health visits. We need to 
have a discussion around whether the girl is feeling ready for sex, 
rather than just talk about birth control.

A Dollar a Day Not to Get Pregnant.
</a></h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
July 9, 2009 &nbsp;
Inside Higher Ed</span>
<p>
A pregnancy prevention program called <i>College Bound Sisters,</i> 
based at the University of North Carolina, pays 12 to 18 year old girls 
one dollar for every day they are not pregnant. The program was founded 
20 years ago.</p>

<p>The money, deposited into a college savings account, is given to 
participants only after they achieve all three goals of the program: not
 getting pregnant, graduating from high school and enrolling in college.
 The girls also receive $5 per week for transportation to the program's 
classes in sexual health and preparation for college. Some students who 
have stuck with it have received over $2,000 toward a college degree.</p>

<p>The program is for girls whose sisters had a baby before the age of 
18: if the sister is pregnant, the girl is at risk for similar behavior.
 No one in the program has parents who have been college graduates.</p>

<p>Money seems to be only the initial impetus: students stay with it 
because of the education and support they receive. Weekly meetings give 
students sexual education, promoting abstinence but discussing birth 
control for those who are sexually active. The girls also get assistance
 applying for college. The program seems to help girls set their sights 
in the right direction.</p>

<p>The program also seems to help parents and their daughters discuss 
the topics of sex and pregnancy more freely. One parent said the program
 gave her daughter something to strive for. </p>

<p>The program also helps girls with long term goal-setting, and the 
girls learn to see not getting pregnant at a young age as part of a 
long-term path to success.</p>

<p>Of the 125 participants who have stuck with it for more than six 
months, about half have made it all the way through and half have 
dropped out. 5% got pregnant, another 5% dropped out of high school, and
 others parted ways with the program for unrelated reasons. The money 
saved by those who do not make it through the program is divided up 
among the remaining girls. </p>

<p>In a study of the girls who did not go through the program, these 
were four times more likely to become pregnant as teenagers and half as 
likely to enroll in college. No other colleges are known to have started
 a similar program.</p>

<p>The operating costs at $75,000 per year pales in comparison to the 
expenses of a single teen pregnancy, which can cost taxpayers up to half
 a million dollars between healthcare and welfare expenses.</p>

<p>Teen pregnancies currently cost taxpayers $9.1 billion annually, 
according to  the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned 
Pregnancy. With teen birth rates up again for the second year in a row 
after 14 straight years of decline, the director stressed that "we are 
going to need to try new and innovative things."</p>

<p>Other innovative pregnancy prevention approaches include revising 
classroom sexual education to focus on "relationships, not just body 
parts."  Then there are digital messages that remind girls to take their
 birth control pills and online games with sexual education information.</p>

<p>Sex educators are slow to respond to the need for new teaching 
methods. And with budget cuts, it becomes harder for the school to be 
the innovator in sex education programs.

U.S.: Immigration Affects Environment, Too, Reports E -the Environmental
 Magazine; But Solutions go Deeper than Building Fences.

<p>
Immigration has become a hot issue, but often for the wrong reasons. 
What's missing is frank discussion of its impact on overall population 
growth, the environment and on how to address its fundamental causes.</p>

<p>Largely because of immigration, the U.S. Census estimates that from 
303 million today we'll grow to 400 million people as early as 2040, and
 420 million by 2050. The U.S. is growing so fast it now has the third 
largest population in the world.</p>

<p>America is a nation of immigrants. We absorbed 25 million people 
between 1860 and 1920, and most observers believe we are a stronger 
nation because of it.</p>

<p>America's rapid population growth makes it nearly impossible to 
achieve sustainability. About 93% of U.S. increases in energy use since 
1970 can be attributed to population growth. We pave over an area the 
size of Delaware every year, and every day we remove 3.2 billion gallons
 of water from aquifers that are not replenished by natural processes.</p>

<p>The energy and climate effects are little understood. Any efficiency 
gains we make are being swamped by rapid population increases.</p>

<p>With just 5% of the world's population, the U.S. is the top consumer 
of 11 of the world's top 20 traded commodities. The increase in 
greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S., which rose 13 between 1990 and 
2000, mirrors the population increase. A huge percentage of climate 
emissions can be attributed to population growth.</p>

<p>Many people want to come to America from the overpopulated developing
 world. The swelling numbers abroad create pressures leading to 
"increased poverty, hunger, land degradation, a lack of health services 
and limited social and economic mobility."</p>

<p>How do we address these pressures without calling for the mandatory 
caps on U.S. immigration? The organization Population Connection wants 
to combine action at home (reducing teen pregnancy, ensuring 
contraceptive availability, defending reproductive rights) with foreign 
aid. If people see hope for better lives at home, they will feel less 
pressure to emigrate.</p>

<p>Such views have many supporters. If we and the governments of the 
countries they are coming from were to devote as much to improving their
 standard of living at home, they might not feel the need to come to 
America.</p>

<p>The obstacle is to get countries around the world to focus on 
eradicating hunger, infant mortality and poverty, and limiting births 
through universal access to family planning. A 20-year plan to address 
these issues has languished as donor countries, including the U.S., have
 fallen short of meeting their financial commitments.</p>

<p>In addition, the reinstatement of the "Global Gag Rule" which 
mandates that no U.S. family planning assistance be provided to foreign 
organizations that use funding to make abortion available, has had a 
severe impact. Cultural and religious opposition have also combined to 
thwart efforts.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, UNFPA, says that the process offers the best hope for 
reducing migration pressures. The growing poverty and demographic divide
 between rich and poor countries must be addressed.

Immigrant Human Katrina Flooding Into the United States.

<p>
Obama, Hillary and McCain promise to give amnesty to 20-30 million 
illegal aliens, continue chain migration, double U.S. immigration from 
1.0 to 2.0 million annually and accept millions of anchor babies. This 
means 70 million immigrants and their children will flood into America 
by 2040. The following interview with Dr. Albert Bartlett of Colorado 
University will give you plenty of reasons for taking action to prevent 
this.</p>

<p>Lake Mead which provides water for millions of people in the West, 
will dry up by 2023. The cause comes from drought, global warming and 
population growth. Lake Lanier, Georgia has already dried up in 2007 
while Georgia expects to add six million more people in four decades.</p>

<p>We cannot change drought. At the same time, population growth devours
 water faster than it can be recharged. Everyone thinks population 
growth remains inevitable. False! Nature stops populations from growing 
when they cannot obtain enough water or food.</p>

<p>In America, corporations, political leaders, realtors and home 
builders salivate at the word growth. They  pour concrete onto 6,000 
acres daily and 2.19 million acres annually.</p>

<p>It's time to try again to correct the innumerate experts who say that
 growth is inevitable. They fail to recognize that after maturity, 
continued growth is either obesity or cancer.</p>

<p>The authors of growth would like us to believe that the battle 
against growth is lost, so our only role is to be the best losers. We 
should remember that Smart Growth and Dumb Growth both destroy the 
environment, but Smart Growth� destroys the environment with good taste.</p>

<p>Our leaders yank our leash into unending, unacceptable and relentless
 growth? Such growth yields chronic and painful ramifications for 
everyone in America regarding quality of life and standard of living?</p>

<p>What does growth really bring to you and me? It creates a few rich 
people. It brings more homeless and unemployed, more people living in 
poverty, more traffic congestion, higher parking fees, more school 
crowding, more unhappy neighborhoods, more expensive government, more 
and higher taxes, more fiscal problems for the state, more air and water
 pollution, higher utility costs, diminished democracy, crowded 
highways, growing costs of infrastructure maintenance, higher food costs
 and more destruction of the environment. You will encounter overloaded 
campgrounds, beaches, ski resorts, more litter, higher gas costs, 
greater housing costs, water shortages and loss of choices and personal 
freedom.</p>

<p>It's not clear why the government would think that people would want 
these known consequences of growth. Crude oil increased from $20 a 
barrel in 2002 to $100 a barrel in 2008. We could look at $500 a barrel 
in another six years.</p>

<p>Culprit? Immigration causes 80% of our growth!</p>

<p>By their continued promotion of growth, the innumerates are speeding 
the arrival of painful but predictable shortages and consequent 
rationing of gasoline, natural gas and water across America. </p>

<p>Bartlett concluded: The arithmetic of population, resources and 
growth is inexorable. The consequences cannot be avoided by believing 
that wishing will make it so.

Mexico: Toward a Green Agenda on Immigration .
</a></h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
April 18, 2006 &nbsp;
Grist Magazine</span>
<p>
The debate in Congress over immigration, has touched very little on 
NAFTA. But the issues are related, for NAFTA stipulates that capital and
 goods must flow freely across the U.S.-Mexico border, while leaving 
policy about labor to the respective governments.</p>

<p>Right now, the battle is being waged between Republicans who want to 
punish undocumented Mexican workers and Republicans who want to exploit 
them. Kennedy will succeed in cobbling together a bill that preserves a 
militarized border, a guest-worker program and a large disenfranchised 
army of undocumented workers.</p>

<p>In the last decade, businesses have been able to easily relocate 
overseas. Meanwhile, workers fleeing Mexico's crumbling rural economy 
have been sneaking north. The argument that "they're taking jobs 
Americans don't want" doesn't tell the whole story. Illegal immigration 
has been a boon to Wal-Mart and its shareholders -- and not just because
 the retail behemoth has itself exploited it. Thus the global model 
embodied by NAFTA -- capital and goods move freely, while workers are 
restricted, has led to rising corporate profitability and stagnating 
wages.</p>

<p>The immigration boom is a legacy of the free-trade fervor that 
conquered the Mexican elite in the early 1980s. The U.S. investor class 
has reaped the benefits.</p>

<p>If we agree that a global economic system hinged on export and 
long-distance trade is energy-intensive, and that U.S. policy has worked
 to promote global trade, then a way forward comes into view.</p>

<p>An environmentalism that challenges this status quo has potential to 
bolster sustainability. By promoting local production for local 
consumption on both sides of the border, the U.S. economy can wean 
itself from its addiction to Mexican labor. And the Mexican economy can 
begin to work for its own citizens.  To do so means challenging the 
assumption that state power exists to promote long-distance trade. One 
place: the 2007 Farm Bill, which will govern how the government 
subsidizes agriculture. Since the 1970s, the federal government has 
spent hundreds of billions of dollars rewarding production of 
environmentally ruinous commodities like corn, which threaten rural 
livelihoods in Mexico.</p>

<p>Let's work to promote organic agriculture destined for nearby 
consumption. Ending the commodity-corn subsidy will instantly provide 
relief to rural Mexicans now contemplating a trip north.

U.S.: We Don't Need 'Guest Workers'.

In 1964 Congress killed the seasonal Mexican laborers program despite 
warnings that its abolition would doom the tomato industry.  Then 
scientists developed oblong tomatoes that could be harvested by machine 
and California's tomato output has risen fivefold. Now we're being 
warned again that we need unskilled laborers from Mexico and Central 
America to relieve U.S. "labor shortages." Guest workers would mainly 
legalize today's vast inflows of illegal immigrants, with the same 
consequence: We'd be importing poverty. They generally don't go home, 
assimilation is slow and the ranks of the poor are constantly 
replenished. Since 1980 the number of Hispanics with incomes below the 
government's poverty line has risen 162%, while the number of 
non-Hispanic whites in poverty rose 3% and blacks, 9.5%. What we have 
now is a policy of creating poverty in the US while relieving it in 
Mexico. It stresses local schools, hospitals and housing and feeds 
social tensions (witness the Minutemen). Some Americans get cheap 
landscaping services but if more mowed their own lawns it wouldn't be a 
tragedy. Among immigrant Mexican and Central American workers in 2004, 
only 7% had a college degree and nearly 60% lacked a high school 
diploma. Among native-born U.S. workers, 32% had a college degree and 6%
 did not have a high school diploma.  The illegal immigrants represent 
only about 4.9% of the labor force. In no major occupation are they a 
majority. They're drawn here by wage differences, not labor "shortages."
 Most new illegal immigrants can get work by accepting wages below 
prevailing levels. Hardly anyone thinks that illegal immigrants will 
leave, but what would happen if illegal immigration stopped and wasn't 
replaced by guest workers? Some employers would raise wages to attract 
U.S. workers; others would find ways to minimize those costs. The number
 of native high school dropouts with jobs declined by 1.3 million from 
2000 to 2005. Some lost jobs to immigrants and unemployment remains high
 for some groups. Business organizations support guest worker programs -
 they like cheap labor and ignore the consequences. Why do liberals 
support a program that worsens poverty and inequality? Poor immigrant 
workers hurt the wages of unskilled Americans. We've never tried a 
policy of real barriers and strict enforcement against companies that 
hire illegal immigrants. Until that's shown to be ineffective, we 
shouldn't adopt guest worker programs that add to serious social 
problems.

U.S.: Family Planning Need Seen in Study.
</a></h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
November 11, 2010 &nbsp;
San Antonio Express-News</span>
<p>
In a study over a six-month period, more than 400 pregnant women asked 
to be sterilized after giving birth. Of those, almost a third left the 
hospital without getting the procedure, for one reason or another. And 
within 12 months, close to half the women who wanted but didn't get a 
tubal ligation were pregnant again.</p>

<p>"The women who weren't getting their tubes tied were just kind of 
falling out of the safety net," said Dr. Andrea Thurman, an associate 
professor at Eastern Virginia Medical School in Norfolk.</p>

<p>"These were women who had a lot of pregnancies," ... "They don't have
 good access to health care, they're more likely to be undocumented 
immigrants, they're not likely to be able to interact in the same way 
with getting birth control and they end up pregnant within a year."</p>

<p>The federal government is trying to decide whether to include 
contraception and sterilization among preventive health services — like 
flu shots — to be offered free to patients under the new health reform 
law.</p>

<p>An Institute of Medicine committee is set to meet next week to come 
up with recommendations. </p>

<p>Some religious and conservative groups are opposed. "To prevent 
pregnancy is not to prevent a disease — indeed, contraception and 
sterilization pose their own unique and serious health risks to the 
patient," the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops wrote in letter to the
 Department of Health and Human Services in October.</p>

<p>Female sterilization and the birth control pill are tied as the No. 1
 method of contraception in the United States, each used by about 17% of
 women 44 years old and younger.</p>

<p>Sterilization is more popular with minority women, used by about 20% 
of Hispanics and 22% of African Americans, according to the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention.</p>

<p>Even women covered for prenatal care and hospital delivery under 
Medicaid and CHIP can end up paying out-of-pocket costs ranging from 
$200 at the time of C-section, to more than $1,000.</p>

<p>A mandatory waiting period of at 30 days or longer from the time a 
consent form is signed — designed to keep women from being coerced into 
sterilization — leads to some losing their Medicaid coverage before they
 can undergo the surgery, Thurman said.</p>

<p>Dr. Joseph Potter, professor of sociology at the University of Texas 
at Austin, is studying the availability of tubal ligation in El Paso 
through a Society of Family Planning grant. He said Thurman's study 
proves sterilization can be cost-effective for women who want it.</p>

<p>"The problem isn't the demand for sterilization," Potter said. 
"There's plenty of demand. Poor people just don't have the $1,000 or 
$2,000 to pay for it."</p>

<p>Liza Fuentes, a New York doctoral student who interviewed poor women 
in the Lower Rio Grande Valley about family planning for an advocacy 
group a few years ago, said some scrimp and save for sterilization, or 
work out a payment plan with their doctor.</p>

<p>“For people who don't have health insurance or have spotty access to 
health care, the idea of a tubal ligation may be attractive (compared to
 other forms of birth control) because it's not dependent on having 
regular care," Fuentes said.</p>

<p>“There are women that, for one reason or another, a tubal ligation 
makes really good sense for them and their family. I wish that all women
 who wanted contraception were able to access it. Politics aside, 
contraception is extremely cost effective. Half of pregnancies in this 
country are either unintended or mistimed."

receiving it will experience the mutually beneficial, benefits. However,
 this will most likely unfold over the course of two generations of 
living and working with the people who are being helped to escape the 
vicious circle of poverty and hopelessness.

Wisconsin Makes Push on Free Birth Control.
</a></h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
August 18, 2010 &nbsp;
The Wall Street Journal (U.S.)</span>
<p>
Wisconsin is pushing to expand a program that uses federal Medicaid 
funds to provide free contraception to low-income people. It and 26 
other states already provide free contraception and other 
reproductive-health services through a Medicaid pilot project to 
lower-earning women who otherwise wouldn't qualify. </p>

<p>Among other things, the women get access to prescription birth 
control, Pap smears, testing for sexually transmitted diseases and, in 
some states, infertility treatments. Women qualify for Wisconsin's 
program if they make up to $21,600 a year for single people - twice the 
federal poverty level.</p>

<p>The state touts it as cost-effective. The state's Medicaid director 
credits it with preventing unplanned pregnancies that "I don't think 
anybody wants." But critics point out that it allows girls and boys as 
young as 15 to participate without having to notify their parents.</p>

<p>Now Wisconsin wants to widen the reach of its plan. A provision in 
the health-care law allows states to make their plans permanent and get 
federal funding faster. Wisconsin applied to raise the qualifying limit 
to $32,490.
"That's just insane," said Julaine Appling, president of Wisconsin 
Family Action, a conservative lobbying group. "That is a whole new 
segment of our population that is now seeking reproductive health care 
on taxpayer money."

From Quantum Physicist to Champion of Sustainability Biodiversity, 
Activist - Vandana Shiva.
</a></h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
November 14, 2007 &nbsp;
Student Operated Press</span>
<p>
Even in her early childhood, Vandana Shiva, born in 1952 in a small 
village at the foot of the Himalayas, wanted to be a scientist. After 
living in Canada she left with a doctorate, but confronted with poverty,
 injustice and environmental destruction, she saw herself as an 
environmentalist and human rights advocate. The alternative Nobel prize 
winner studied the multitude of tree species, forest plants and 
traditional agriculture of her homeland.</p>

<p>The illiterate peasant women from the high Himalayas taught her to 
recognise the value of nature and the urgency of defending it. The 
peasant women have bred seeds which are optimal for the soil condition 
and environment, and have, through exchange and cross-breeding, 
developed an astonishing agricultural biodiversity. For many years 
Vandana Shiva has worked for the rights of small peasants in India, who 
are losing control over their own seeds. 
Her campaigning led her to directly criticize international industry and
 trade circles.</p>

<p>The WTO agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual property 
(TRIPs) criminalises the storage of a portion of a harvest for planting 
the next year as well as the millenia-old practice of exchanging seeds 
between farmers". In addition, the agricultural agreement legalises the 
with genetically modified food crops and criminalises the protection of 
biological and cultural diversity, on which the variety of nutritional 
systems depends.</p>

<p>Shiva's understanding of democracy reclaims the freedom of 
development for individual life-forms and the sovereignty of peoples 
over water resources, food and quality of clothing. Vandana highlights 
alternatives to the monopolisation of life and natural resources. She 
counters the centralised power of multinational corporations with 
decentralised structures based on peaceful co-existence. </p>

<p>She transfers insights from quantum theory to human ecological 
actions. In the end everything is connected with everything else, says 
the environmentalist.

U.S.: New Health Reform Law Will Benefit 30 Million Women, Study Says.
</h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
July 30, 2010 &nbsp;
National Partnership for Women &amp; Families</span>
<p>
The new national health reform law (PL 111-148) is estimated to benefit 
thirty million women according to the Commonwealth Fund. The law will 
help 15 million uninsured women gain access to subsidized coverage and 
also will improve cost and quality issues for 14.5 million women who are
 currently insured.</p>

<p>15 million of the 17 million uninsured U.S. women will be able to 
obtain health coverage with federal assistance. Once eligibility is 
expanded 7.5 million  will qualify for Medicaid, while the other 7.5 
million will benefit from government subsidies to purchase insurance on 
the state insurance exchanges that will be established in 2014.</p>

<p>Almost 40% of women who attempted to purchase coverage through the 
individual insurance market over a 3 year period were either rejected, 
charged higher prices than other consumers or denied due to a 
pre-existing medical condition.</p>

<p>Care for pregnant women is included. Nearly 90% of health plans on 
the individual market currently lack maternity coverage.</p>

<p>Other benefits to women include the extension of family coverage to 
young adult children, a ban on lifetime coverage limits, phased-in 
restrictions on annual benefit limits, improved coverage of preventive 
services and $250 rebate checks for prescription coverage for some 
Medicare beneficiaries.

U.S.: Justice Ginsburg Says Roe Will Be Upheld, Applauds Kagan.

<span class="smallfont">

Politico</span>
<p>
Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg predicted that the U.S. "will 
never go back to the way it once was" before Roe v. Wade. She also said 
that current legal challenges do not completely eliminate abortion 
rights.</p>

<p>Abortion restrictions hurt poor women - "If people realize that, 
maybe they will have a different attitude." Since Roe, "over a 
generation of young women have grown up, understanding they can control 
their own reproductive capacity, and in fact their life's destiny."</p>

<p>Ginsburg first met Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan during a federal
 clerkship Kagan held and later "grew to know" her during Ginsburg's 
Supreme Court confirmation hearings in 1993. She praised Kagan's 
performance during her Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearings.

U.S.: Working Group Advocates for Over-the-Counter Access to Birth 
Control Pill.
</h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
July 8, 2010 &nbsp;
Newsweek</span>
<p>
The Oral Contraceptive Over-the-Counter Working Group, a coalition of 
women's health experts, aims to gain FDA approval to market an oral 
contraceptive for nonprescription use, citing evidence that 
nonprescription access does not compromise safety.</p>

<p>The group, funded by the Hewlett Foundation, believes 
prescription-only access to birth control patronizes women, restricts 
contraceptive freedom and does little to curb teen pregnancy rates. 
There are barriers that have to do with the logistics of insurance, or 
the policy at the doctor's office.</p>

<p>The group, focusing on the so-called "mini-pill,"  hopes to have the 
pill on the market within five years. The mini-pill has a lower risk of 
adverse effects than other hormonal methods, and typically is prescribed
 to women who are lactating or have a higher risk of complications, such
 as stroke and heart attack, because they smoke or are older than age 
35. It contains the same synthetic hormone -- progestin -- that is used 
in the OTC emergency contraceptives Plan B and Next Choice.</p>

<p>Teens find it is difficult to visit a doctor's office without a 
parent's help. Nearly 20% of sexually active teens who do not want to 
become pregnant are not using contraceptives, according to the 
Guttmacher Institute. A 2006 study published in Contraception found that
 68% of surveyed women said they wanted a birth control pill that was 
available without a prescription, with uninsured women showing a high 
level of interest.</p>

<p>Until recently providers followed guidelines to perform a pelvic exam
 and Pap test at every family planning visit, but new guidelines suggest
 that most women need less frequent screening.</p>

<p>"Holding birth control hostage until women have had a pelvic exam is a
 paternalistic attitude to women's health." The two aren't linked.</p>

<p>One concern is that moving to OTC status could cause the pill's cost 
to jump, which is what happened when EC became available without a 
prescription, however, supporters are investigating strategies to keep 
costs down.

Federal Officials Weigh Inclusion of Birth Control in Preventive Care 
Benefits.
</h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
July 6, 2010 &nbsp;
National Partnership for Women &amp; Families</span>
<p>
Beginning this fall, the federal health reform law (PL 111-148) will 
require health insurance plans to offer certain preventive health 
services at no direct cost to patients, and many women's health 
advocates and employer groups hope that contraception is included among 
those benefits.</p>

<p>The Health Resources and Services Administration will take up to a 
year to recommend coverage for many services, including contraceptive 
services.</p>

<p>Several health plans already cover prescription contraceptives -- and
 27 states require some level of contraceptive coverage. Further 
improving access to contraception by lowering out-of-pocket costs could 
help reduce the estimated three million annual unintended pregnancies in
 the U.S.
Women who plan their pregnancies are more likely to obtain recommended 
prenatal care and space births, which can improve outcomes. </p>

<p>In addition, lowering the cost of contraception could encourage the 
use of longer-acting methods, such as hormonal implants and intrauterine
 devices, which are more cost-effective and reliable but have higher 
upfront costs. Or young women would be able to purchase a longer supply 
of birth control pills, lessening the risk of running out of pills at an
 inopportune time.</p>

<p>The average annual cost to health plans for providing family planning
 services is about $40 per member, while covering a worker's prenatal 
and maternity care can cost an employer $8,000 to $11,000.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops opposes the 
classification of contraception as a preventive service. "Fertility is 
not a disease to be cured, and the government should not treat it as 
that"

'Greed Culture' Killing Planet.
</h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
January 14, 2010 &nbsp;
Guardian (London)</span>
<p>
The average American consumes more than his or her weight in products 
each day, fuelling a global culture that is emerging as the biggest 
threat to the planet. In its annual report, Worldwatch Institute says 
the cult of consumption and greed could wipe out any gains from 
government action on climate change or a shift to a clean energy 
economy.</p>

<p>"Until we recognise that our environmental problems, from climate 
change to species loss, are driven by unsustainable habits, we will not 
be able to solve the ecological crises."</p>

<p>Humanity is burning through the planet's resources at a reckless 
rate. The world now digs up the equivalent of 112 Empire State buildings
 of material every day to meet surging global demand.</p>

<p>The consumer culture has spread from America across the globe, with 
excess now accepted as a symbol of success in developing countries.</p>

<p>China this week overtook the US as the world's top car market.</p>

<p>Such trend are the result of efforts by businesses to win over 
consumers.</p>

<p>The average Western family spends more on their pet than is spent by a
 human in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>Encouraging signs are that schools are trying to encourage healthier 
eating habits among children; a younger generation is also more aware of
 their environmental impact; and US corporations such as Wal-Mart were 
stocking organic produce and sustainably raised fish.</p>

<p>It said a wholesale transformation of values and attitudes was needed
 to end the world's obsession with conspicuous consumption.

Drug War, Taliban, Poppies Are All in Full Flower.
</a></h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
December 17, 2006 &nbsp;
San Francisco Chronicle</span>
<p>
Five years since the start of the Afghan war, the Taliban both supports 
and draws support from that profitable crop: opium. Afghanistan provides
 92% of the world's heroin.</p>

<p>Yet Western policies to eliminate the Taliban and the poppy are at 
odds with each other. NATO troops scramble to rebuild rural 
infrastructure, U.S. advisers urge Afghan anti-narcotics police to 
eradicate the livelihood of 2 million poor farmers.</p>

<p>The poppy-eradication program last year, claimed to have destroyed 
38,000 acres of poppies, up from 12,000 the year before; but during the 
same period poppy cultivation soared from 104,000 hectares to 165,000 
hectares. In 2001, poppies were grown on only 7,600 hectares. The 
counterproductive eradication program makes life miserable for thousands
 of small farmers and their families.</p>

<p>An international drug-policy think tank reports that the program not 
only ruins small farmers but drives them into the arms of the Taliban, 
which gives them loans, protection and a chance to plant again. Big 
farmers are undeterred by the eradication program; they simply pay off 
the police and associated officials. </p>

<p>The US in the 1980s fought a proxy war against the Soviet Union, 
encouraging Islamist extremists and setting the stage for the Taliban.</p>

<p>Administration officials worry that the drug trade may destabilize 
the country and the region.</p>

<p>Karzai often promises to rid the country of drug lords, but as a 
realist, he keeps his enemies close. His strategy is to avoid 
confrontation. Among the 249 members of the lower house are at least 17 
drug traffickers, 40 commanders of armed militias, 24 members of 
criminal gangs, and 19 men facing serious allegations of war crimes and 
human rights violations. During the Soviet occupation of the 1980s, the 
CIA sponsored anti-Soviet Islamist extremists, and fostered the drug 
trade. Before the  mujahedeen took on the Soviets in 1979, Afghanistan 
produced a very small amount of opium and no heroin. By the end of the 
jihad it was the world's top producer of both drugs.</p>

<p>The British, who were responsible for international anti-narcotics 
operations in Afghanistan, tried to persuade Afghan farmers to grow 
other crops but none requires less work or produces the profits of opium
 poppies. Within Afghanistan, profits may reach $3 billion this year; 
but international traffickers will make 10 times as much. The profit 
that stays in Afghanistan enriches warlords, government officials, 
politically connected smugglers. But it also create jobs and a booming 
trade. This adds up to an estimated 60% of Afghanistan's GDP. The poppy 
farmer makes a decent living. Nevertheless, some poppy farmers were 
persuaded to give up poppy for tomatoes. They harvested good crops, then
 watched them rot because a promised bridge they needed to get their 
tomatoes to market hadn't been built.</p>

<p>Afghans, being practical and desperate came up with a plan.</p>

<p>Afghan farmers officially proposed that they be licensed to grow 
poppy and produce opium for state-owned refineries that in turn, would 
produce medicinal morphine and codeine for worldwide legal sale.</p>

<p>One expert the administration sent to Kabul to assess the "drug 
problem" admitted that the only sensible way out is to legalize drugs 
but nobody wants to hear that.</p>

<p>In November 2004, U.S. funds for the war on drugs increased $780 
million, including $150 million for aerial spraying.

Human Consumption Unsustainable.
</h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
September 26, 2009 &nbsp;
Nipomo Free Press / The Sustainability Project</span>
<p>
Severn Susuki, environmental activist and daughter of Dr. David Susuki, 
environmentalist has some very important concerns. We consume about 40% 
percent of Earth's primary productivity. Every day we burn up an amount 
of energy the planet needed over 27 years to create.</p>

<p>The U.S. population constitutes only 5% of world population, but 
consumes 24% of world's energy. The U.S. is losing 400,000 acres of 
rural land per year, while urbanized land area increased between 1969 
and 1990 at twice the rate of population growth in the same time period.</p>

<p>Cities lost 33-50% of their pre-1950 population density, as 
automobiles became the primary mode of transportation and families moved
 to the suburbs.
The average suburban shopping center takes up as much land as the core 
center of the city of Florence, Italy.</p>

<p>These are only a few of the statistics showing that our current 
levels of consumption are not sustainable. We cannot continue gobbling 
up our diminishing oil supplies and rural lands at the rate we have been
 doing. We need to bring our social, economic and environmental systems 
back into balance in a way that replenishes them for future generations.</p>

<p>Is our city sprawling outward, or is it becoming more compact, 
walkable and transit oriented? Are we creating convenient transit 
systems, and mixed-use streetscapes that encourage walking and biking? 
What percentage of our land use is devoted to neighborhoods where people
 are within a 10-minute walk of basic necessities?</p>

<p>Do city residents have greater access to public parks, plazas, 
community gardens and urban farms than to parking lots, strip malls and 
big-box stores? Are we encouraging the use of renewable energy, while 
reducing the use of carbon-based fuels?</p>

<p>"I think this is the most exciting time to be alive in all of human 
history. In the following months and years, we're going to have to make 
some big decisions. 
Whether we make the right decisions or fail to make the decisions, will 
determine the fate, not only of all human kind, but of countless species
 of plants and animals.</p>

<p>"This is the defining moment, when we will decide whether or not 
we're going to be a spectacular, flash- in-the-pan failure, or whether 
we can step up to the plate and show that we are capable of finding 
humility, compassion, patience and wisdom to truly find a sustainable 
path."

<p>County commissioners denied a request to raze the 962-square-foot

 was complex: The parcel of land is part of a wildlife migration 
corridor; the house would teeter on important riparian habitat; the land
 is designated of "statewide agricultural importance"; and the house 
would not exist "harmoniously" with its neighborhood, among other 
arguments.</p>

Any individual will encounter terms such as carrying capacity, limiting 
factors and exponential growth. Yet few implement the concept of 
sustainability.</p>

<p>Until people question the existence, of the global environmental 
crisis, the population stabilization and reduction initiative will 
remain little more than a lobby largely ignored by politicians.</p>

<p>The US has been unable to serve as an example. Any way of life that 
is unlike our own, is a threat and must promptly be democratized, 
modernized and westernized.</p>

<p>The symptoms of a society that is straining under its own weight are 
all there, yet we've successfully managed to evade the issue by 
misdiagnosing, and offering temporary solutions to the problem. While 
the United States birth rate has decreased, our lenient immigration 
policies continue to increase our population. Experts predict that the 
United States population, if left unchecked, is expected to double in 70
 years to a total of 540 million people.</p>

<p>We must begin our public discourse when consensus is met; sacrifices 
will have to be made, for democracy can only deal with the ever-changing
 present while relegating responsibility for the future to the few who 
care to take it upon themselves.</p>

<p>An average U.S. citizen consumes 50 times more goods and services 
than a Chinese citizen and approximately twice as many as a Western 
European. </p>

<p>Only recently, during spikes in gas prices, has the engineers' task 
turned to designing automobiles and engines which reduce consumption and
 emissions. 
Our challenge is to stir the minds and hearts of our fellow Americans so
 that they may awaken to this reality, directing this change for the 
better before it is snatched from us.

U.S.;: Why Working Less is Better for the Globe.
</a></h4>
<span class="smallfont">

AlterNet</span>
<p>
Americans are working harder than ever before. We seem more determined 
to work harder and produce more.  Choosing to work less is the biggest 
environmental issue no one's talking about.</p>

<p>The Work Less Party is a growing initiative aimed at cutting work 
hours while tackling unemployment, environment, and boosting leisure 
time. Working less would produce less, consume less, pollute less and 
live more.</p>

<p>We work 250 hours, or five weeks, more than the Brits, and a whopping
 500 hours, or 12 and a half weeks, more than the Germans. Longer hours 
plus labor-saving technology equals ever-increasing productivity. 
Without high annual growth to match productivity, there's unemployment. 
Maintaining growth means using more energy and resources, which results 
in increased waste and pollution.</p>

<p>The US is the world's largest polluter. When people work longer 
hours, they rely increasingly on fast food, disposable diapers, or 
bottled water. Earning more means spending money in ways that are 
environmentally detrimental. When people are time-starved they don't 
have enough time to be conscious consumers. If Europe moved towards a 
U.S. based economic model, it would consume 15-30% more energy by 2050.</p>

<p>The problem is, France has already begun following America's lead by 
increasing the workload. France's increased productivity would create 
even larger problems. In both the US and Europe, work hours declined 
from the beginning of the industrial revolution until World War II. 
After the war, the 40-hour workweek was legally in place. Since the 
1970s, most European governments have continued shortening work hours 
whereas the United States has opted instead to let wages fall. The USA 
has declined relative to all other industrial countries in health, 
equality, savings, sustainability. What's happened in Europe is people 
have discovered it's nice to have some time in their lives, and they've 
wanted more. Here, business has kept that door completely shut.</p>

<p>Take Back Your Time has launched a campaign in the US calling for 
legislation guaranteeing a minimum of three weeks of paid vacation.</p>

<p>The average vacation in the United States is now only a long weekend,
 and 25% percent of American workers have no paid vacation, according to
 the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But we continue to suffer from 
overload, debt, and anxiety, and are stuck in a fatalistic rat race 
generated by heightened consumerism. Our society is focused on work that
 makes stuff that goes directly into landfills. Essential work such as 
art, music, creativity, community, the kind necessary to create a 
healthy society and planet, is being negated in favor of that.</p>

<p>If you want to protect the environment, you have to consume less, 
which means you have to produce less, and you have to work less. Our 
standard of living will improve hugely.

Farm-Raised Fish Given Tainted Food.
</a></h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
May 09, 2007 &nbsp;
New York Times*</span>
<p>
A chemical that American regulators have identified as a pet food 
contaminant may have been intentionally added to animal feed by 
producers seeking larger profits. Three chemical makers said Chinese 
animal feed producers often purchased cyanuric acid to blend into their 
feed because it was cheaper and helped increase protein content. 
American regulators had focused on melamine and animal feed producers 
acknowledged that for years they added melamine to animal feed to gain 
bigger profits.</p>

<p>But American regulators have also been aware for several weeks that 
cyanuric acid may have played a role in causing sickness or death in 
pets.</p>

<p>China said that it had found two companies guilty of intentionally 
exporting pet food ingredients containing melamine.</p>

<p>China's watchdog for quality control said officials at the two 
companies were detained for their roles in shipping tainted goods. In 
China, chemical producers say it is common knowledge that for years feed
 producers have secretly used cyanuric acid to cheat buyers of animal 
feed.</p>

<p>The FDA said that farmed fish had been fed meal contaminated with 
melamine and other contaminants but that the level was probably too low 
to harm anyone who ate the fish. Two of the Chinese chemical makers say 
that cyanuric acid is used because it is even cheaper than melamine and 
high in nitrogen, enabling feed producers to artificially increase 
protein readings. They also produce a chemical which is a combination of
 melamine and cyanuric acid, and that feed producers have often sought 
to purchase scrap material from this product.</p>

<p>Scientists studying the pet food deaths say the combination of the 
two chemicals may have created a toxic punch that formed crystals in the
 kidneys of pets and led to kidney failure.</p>

<p>A joint assessment by FDA and other federal agencies said there was a
 very low risk of danger to humans who consume meat from animals that 
were accidentally fed melamine-tainted feed.</p>

<p>China acknowledged Tuesday that two companies had cheated pet food 
companies by adding a fake protein. Chemical producers of cyanuric acid 
say the substance is nontoxic, it's legal to add it to animal feed. The 
practice has been around for many years.

U.S. Tells California to Cut Water Use to Save Fish.
</a></h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
June 2009 &nbsp;
Reuters</span>
<p>
Salmon and other fish have been pushed to the brink of extinction by 
Californians' demand for water, ruled the National Marine Fisheries 
Service, a federal agency. Officials were ordered to cut water supplies 
by 5-7% to cities and farms.</p>

<p>To turn southern desert into productive farmland, a monumental system
 of dams and pipelines were built, leaving less water for trout, salmon,
 sturgeon and other fish.</p>

<p>With the state in its third year of drought, and climate change and a
 growing population, the fate of some salmon runs looks untenable 
without change.</p>

<p>If water conservation, recycling and groundwater use do not offset 
the cuts, the state may be more tempted to build more dams and canals to
 capture the last trickles that bypass the system.</p>

<p>U.S. Bureau of Reclamation regional director said the mounting 
restrictions on water "just cannot be offset in any given year and maybe
 over time." State and federal water projects this year have slashed 
deliveries to about 40 percent of most requests, due to drought, and 
agricultural losses are expected near $1 billion.</p>

<p>The fisheries agency plans to keep more water behind big dams during 
the year to ensure a supply of cold water in which salmon spawn, 
restrict some pumping, and find ways for fish to get to historical 
spawning grounds upriver from dams.

Supreme Court Hears Case on Navy Sonar, Whales.
</a></h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
October 09, 2008 &nbsp;
Los Angeles Times</span>
<p>
The Supreme Court was closely split on whether environmental laws can be
 used to protect marine mammals from the Navy's use of sonar. An 
administration lawyer urged the court to throw out a Los Angeles judge's
 order that requires the Navy to turn off its high intensity sonar 
whenever a whale or dolphin is within 1.2 miles of a ship.</p>

<p>This order disrupts the Navy's war-game exercises. U.S. Solicitor 
Gen. Gregory Garre disputed claims that the sonar causes harm to the 
whales.</p>

<p>But lawyer Richard B. Kendall said beaked whales dive deeply to 
escape the sound, and sometimes suffer bleeding and death when they try 
to resurface. He also said the order has had a minimal impact on the 
Navy. Only on a few occasions have ships been forced to turn off their 
sonar.</p>

<p>The case has turned into a major dispute over whether judges have the
 power to stop the government from conducting a crucial exercise because
 it had not carried out an environmental impact statement.</p>

<p>Justice Stephen G. Breyer wondered "Why couldn't you work this out?" 
rather than having a court resolve the dispute.

A federal judge ruled that wolves should be returned to the

Death of the Bees: GMO Crops and the Decline of Bee Colonies in North 
America.
</a></h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
March 25, 2008 &nbsp;
Global Research</span>
<p>
There are many reasons given to the decline in Bees, but one that 
matters most is the use of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) and 
"Terminator Seeds" that are being endorsed by governments and utilized 
as our agricultural needs of survival.</p>

<p>Genetically modified seeds are produced by biotech conglomerates who 
manipulate government agricultural policy with a view to dominance in 
the agricultural industry. American conglomerates have created seeds 
that reproduce only under certain conditions, often linked to the use of
 their own brands of fertilizer and/or insecticide. </p>

<p>The genetic modification leads to the concurrent genetic modification
 of the flower pollen. When the pollen becomes genetically modified or 
sterile, the bees will become malnourished and die of illness due to the
 lack of nutrients and the interruption of the digestive capacity of 
what they feed on.</p>

<p>There are arguments that the blame be placed on mites, pesticides, or
 cell phone radiation, but digestive shutdown due to hard material in 
the digestive tract that compromises the immune system points to GMO 
flower pollen. </p>

<p>This increased epidemic of the bee colony collapse has risen 
significantly since the use of GMO in our foods. It is also suspect in 
the rise of new cases of medical ailments in humans such as colon 
cancer, obesity, heart disease, etc.</p>

<p>The Ecological Impact of horizontal gene transfer and increase of 
rampant disease is not fully examined and if so, is kept silent by these
 Conglomerates. Organic farming is relatively untouched as the bee 
crisis. The economic impact that the scarcity of bees will potentially 
have on our society is very worrisome.

<div class="comment">Karen Gaia says: another factor mentioned elsewhere
 is the gathering together of a large portion of a country's bees to 
pollinate large mono crops such as almonds. When the bees comingle with 
many other bees, this exposes them to any disease than may be present - 
similar to the global spread of epidemics among humans. The more people 
there are, the more corporations profit by economy of scale, and this 
makes GMO research and large scale food production even more profitable.
 Of course, the risks are often ignored until disaster strikes.</div>

US Colorado: Local Lynx Survival in Doubt.
</a></h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
March 01, 2008 &nbsp;
Durango Herald</span>
<p>
Federal wildlife officials will not designate land in Colorado as 
critical habitat for lynx. They are uncertain whether the habitat in 
Colorado will support a lynx population. The agency left Colorado out of
 its proposal to designate more than 40,000 square miles in six states 
as critical lynx habitat, despite the success of Colorado's 
reintroduction program. The agency's main concern was the decreasing 
number of litters born in the wild.</p>

<p>Canada lynx were first released into the southern San Juan Mountains 
in 1999; today, about 150 radio-collared lynx roam throughout Colorado.</p>

<p>The Fish and Wildlife Services' concerns are valid, in Colorado, it's
 still an experiment whether lynx are going to survive or not.</p>

<p>The majority live on U.S. Forest Service land outside Durango. Their 
territory stretches from Durango north to Silverton and from Dolores 
east to Pagosa Springs.</p>

<p>At Durango Mountain Resort, lynx are commonly spotted passing through
 the ski area. It seems to be an area that's very important for lynx.</p>

<p>State biologists report they are in excellent health, but the U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service is concerned about a recent dip in litter 
numbers.</p>

<p>Nearly 100 kittens were born in the wild in 2004 and 2005. Litter 
totals dropped to 11 in 2006 and hit zero in 2007. That was a surprise 
and the division will be watching litter sizes closely in the next few 
years. Biologists believe lynx can survive three years of low 
reproduction rates.</p>

<p>Colorado has the habitat to allow lynx to survive well into the 
future.</p>

<p>Environmentalists disagree, arguing that one of the best ways to 
protect lynx is to protect their habitat.</p>

<p>On the one hand, the US Fish and Wildlife is going to designate 
critical habitat. On the other hand, they're saying we're not sure about
 the viability of lynx. Environmental groups will probably bring a 
lawsuit against Fish and Wildlife over the exclusion of Colorado and 
other areas from the proposal. Reintroduction efforts in Colorado will 
continue.</p>

<p>We believe we can reach a sustainable population in Colorado. It can 
be 10, 20 years before we can really know. Our program won't change.

U.S.: Humans: the Number One Threat to Birds.
</a></h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
2008 &nbsp;
Alley Cat Allies</span>
<p>
Concern over the declining populations of certain bird species has 
generated debate about the most effective steps toward preserving and 
restoring those populations. The real cause of declining bird 
populations is the impact of the human species.</p>

<p>The major cause of bird species loss is habitat destruction, caused 
by a myriad of human activities, including logging, crop farming, 
livestock grazing, mining, industrial and residential development, urban
 sprawl, road building, dam building, and pesticide use.</p>

<p>Of 1,173 threatened bird species, habitat loss affected 83% of the 
species. Across the US, little land is left untouched by human 
development. Human activities have led to the extinction of 10% of the 
world's bird species, while in some locales, that number rises to 90%. 
Today more than a thousand bird species are listed as threatened, and 
between 500 and 600 of those will go extinct in the next 50 years.</p>

<p>In the US, much of the impact is a result of growing population and 
faster-growing development of land. Between 1990 and 2000, the U.S. 
population grew by 33 million people, the greatest increase the country 
has ever seen. Future growth is predicted to add 27 million people each 
decade for the next 30 years.</p>

<p>An analysis reveals that urbanized land increased by 47% between 1982
 and 1997 and population in suburbs, increased twice as fast as in 
cities. By 2030, half of the buildings will have been built after the 
year 2000. With this level of growth, the loss of bird species - due to 
habitat destruction, pollution, and fragmentation - will continue for 
decades to come.</p>

<p>The real danger to birds is humans.

Alaska Governor Questions Science of Polar Bear Listing.
</a></h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
March 02, 2007 &nbsp;
Houston Chronicle</span>
<p>
Alaska has not decided whether to list polar bears as threatened under 
the Endangered Species Act.</p>

<p>A biologist and special assistant to the Department of Fish and Game,
 questioned whether polar bears really need sea ice to survive. She said
 they are adaptable to use land for hunting, and are adapting to 
alternative food sources.</p>

<p>She testified that a listing in the US ultimately could harm bears in
 Canada because Inuit villagers would no longer have an incentive to 
preserve them. An ESA listing would ban importation of polar bear trophy
 hides.</p>

<p>The fear of restrictions on development from the Endangered Species 
Act may outweigh the desire to add more protections.</p>

<p>The US Fish and Wildlife Service has been vague about what a recovery
 plan might entail if polar bears are listed as threatened. The law 
requires federal agencies to evaluate their actions with respect to 
habitat, in this case, sea ice.</p>

<p>Supporters want the government to declare global warming as the cause
 of harm to polar bear habitat, and consider limits on utilities and 
industry producing greenhouse gasses, throughout the country.</p>

<p>The idea that polar bears can adapt to living on land or can thrive 
on something other than seals flies in the face of the opinion of most 
researchers.</p>

<p>There's not a credible polar bear biologist in the world who would 
make that statement. The driving force in the concern over polar bears 
is the decline in sea ice. When a species' habitat is declining due to 
climate change, but there are no discrete human activities that can be 
regulated or modified to effect change, what do you do?</p>

<p>Critics say polar bears already are closely managed under 
international agreements. The Fish and Wildlife Service agreed, with one
 exception: There is no effective mechanism in place to address the 
recession of sea ice.</p>

<p>The proposed listing is based on the presumption that sea ice will be
 significantly diminished and that sea ice is the most important factor 
for their survival. Preferred food sources such as some ice seal 
populations may be declining, but data indicate that the bears are 
adapting to use alternative food sources. But most of those food sources
 are not enough to maintain a viable population in the long term.</p>

<p>The Fish and Wildlife Service is collecting public testimony until 
April 9. Its decision on listing polar bears is due next January.

U.S.: Chesapeake Bay is Still Hurting.
</a></h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
April 20, 2007 &nbsp;
Baltimore Sun</span>
<p>
There was little good news in the 2006 Assessment put out by the 
Chesapeake Bay Program. The report found degraded water quality, a 
decline in the blue crab population, contaminated rivers and huge losses
 in bay grasses.</p>

<p>The University of Maryland offered a river-by-river report card for 
water clarity, dissolved oxygen levels and quality of life for small 
clams and worms. The results were equally dismal. The flush tax, which 
former Gov. Ehrlich Jr. signed into law in 2004, is expected to raise 
about $65 million a year to upgrade sewage treatment plants to reduce 
pollution.</p>

<p>Dozens of scientists in the region are studying the bay's creatures 
and looking at ways to help them thrive in an increasingly toxic 
environment.</p>

<p>Many said they have grown weary of hearing the same gloomy 
assessments of the bay's health.</p>

<p>The VP of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, said state and federal 
officials have long known what to do but have not the political will to 
do it. </p>

<p>State leaders should be working to secure federal aid for the bay. 
Agriculture is the 800-pound gorilla when you're looking at nutrient 
pollution, but population growth is the 8,000-pound gorilla waiting in 
the wings.

California, Oregon and Washington Plan to Lobby Bush, Congress.
</a></h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
September 19, 2006 &nbsp;
The Seattle Times</span>
<p>
The governors of California, Oregon and Washington announced a pact to 
safeguard the ocean and lobby Congress and the president.</p>

<p>Gov. Schwarzenegger signed seven bills that his office said would 
"extend the state's leadership" on ocean protection.</p>

<p>Our Western states have started to work together to fight global 
warming and protect our air, and we now join forces to make sure we are 
doing everything to maintain clean water and beachess, Schwarzenegger 
said. Members said their efforts would bolster economies by protecting 
coastal tourism and enhancing fisheries.</p>

<p>Key concerns include pollution from urban runoff and the 
environmental effects of off-shore oil drilling.</p>

<p>The U.S. Geological Survey announced a report that shows 66% of 
California's beaches have eroded over the past few decades. The states 
want more money to deal with the problems.</p>

<p>Protecting the oceans isn't likely to leapfrog to the top of the 
national agenda.</p>

<p>The agreement was crafted during the past six months. Similar 
collaboration goes back to 2004, when the three states started trading 
ideas for slashing air pollution. In coming months, experts from the 
participating states plan to meet with environmental and business 
leaders to develop initial recommendations.</p>

<p>The governors intend to send a series of statements to the president 
and Congress, urging them to:</p>

<p>Provide money for programs aimed at curbing urban runoff. Expand 
funding for key regional research efforts.</p>

<p>Request that federal agencies, including the National Oceanographic 
and Atmospheric Administration, are directed to provide technical 
assistance. 
The governors intend to oppose expansion of offshore oil and natural gas
 exploration.</p>

<p>Similar agreements have been negotiated among Great Lakes, Gulf Coast
 and New England states. </p>

<p>California's marine problems have been building for years as people 
cram the coast with development and pollutants endanger sea life.

<p>Any move can spook the animals to flee into the ocean and abandon

1. Federal officials have installed 24-hour surveillance cameras to 
watch for people deliberately swimming, kayaking or sunbathing in the 
area.</p>

<p>Many residents said they were undeterred as it's the only place 
around with a lifeguard station and bathrooms. A steady stream of 
tourists and environmental activists clusters around the roped area, 
unfazed by the stench. The cove has been a popular La Jolla spot since 
the early 1930s. Nobody knows why the animals began flocking to the 
shore in the late 1990s but about 200 seals live there. The rope barrier
 is also meant as a warning to stay away from seal fecal matter and 
birth byproducts.</p>

<p>A California judge ordered the city to dredge and clean up the beach 
but the decision has been tied up in litigation and a foul fishy stench 
remains.</p>

<p>San Diego Council president Scott Peters said he did not feel there 
was evidence of seal harassment. "The issue isn't so much that people 
can't get along with seals, it's that people can't get along with 
people," Peters said.

<h4>

State of the Environment - North Carolina's Most Urgent Environmental 
Challenge.
</h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
December 16, 2005 &nbsp;
Charlotte Observer</span>
<p>
If projections from scientific experts are remotely accurate, North 
Carolina is in for significant change within our lifetimes related to 
global climate change. One estimate says 770 square miles of the coast 
could submerge. Air quality may worsen as temperatures rise, and the 
health of citizens could decline. Some will die of heat stroke. 
Environmental Defense, among others, has suggested a series of 
strategies to limit the harmful impact and prepare its residents to make
 some money off the changes. This year, air quality drops out of the top
 10 problems because there were fewer bad air days, because controls on 
smokestack pollution have begun to take effect. Each of these 
assessments is subjective, not scientific. Summers have been getting 
drier, while falls have been getting wetter. As a consequence, North 
Carolinians have less water available than they did 100 years ago and a 
future with insufficient water in some areas as the state continues its 
dramatic urbanization. Raleigh has problems with one of its key 
reservoirs. Falls Lake which has been below normal level, forcing 
Raleigh to think about asking for a transfer from Kerr Lake. Concord and
 Kannapolis have sought to drain 38 million gallons a day from the 
Catawba River. Storm runoff, nutrients and sediment remain a top 
concern. Development is overwhelming the ability to keep pollution out 
of water supplies but the state is losing the war to protect water 
quality and the environment in North Carolina and America. Rapid growth 
and inappropriate development has been near the top of the list for 10 
years. Residential growth consumes farmland, green space and forests, 
putting new strains on air quality and water quality. But sprawling 
low-density development and quality-of-life concerns could interfere 
with future prosperity. Growth and development has threatened places 
where no one ever imagined. A growth surge in coastal counties has 
caused problems and the land use planning program for the coast is 
totally broken. The very people who depend on waterfront availability 
for their economic survival can no longer afford that access. How North 
Carolina will meet its energy needs at an affordable cost will dominate 
debate affecting the environment. Utilities are interested in building 
more nuclear plants and pressure grows for the state to rescind its 
opposition to offshore natural gas exploration. While some fish stocks 
have made recoveries in N.C. waters, others have declined in alarming 
ways. River herring have become so depleted that catches failed to reach
 a quota limit. Oysters, bay scallops and blue crabs are species of 
"concern" because of low catches. Population growth has increased the 
amount of garbage going into landfills while the state might begin 
importing garbage in landfills proposed for sparsely populated areas an 
environmental threat. The state continues to search for solutions to 
large-scale hog farm waste. Thousands bought up the shoreline and built 
out-of-scale mansions to replace the fish camps and clapboard cottages. 
The loss of natural areas to upscale residential developments has 
changed what North Carolinians see from our windows. Litter accumulates 
along our highways, costing the state millions in collection costs and 
providing volunteers with more work than they can keep up with. Utility 
poles and wires mar the viewscape. Environmental concerns fail to 
consider long-term implications and doesn't recognize the 
interdependence of conservation and development.  North Carolina has 
more than 17 million acres of forests and large stands of trees in 
national and state forests, parks and wildlife reserves. But the huge 
stands of hardwoods and regal longleaf pines are now a small fraction of
 what they once were. In a state where development has gobbled up 
100,000 acres of forested lands and natural areas per year, recent 
legislation may make it harder for local governments to preserve land at
 a time the state's population continues to grow and consume more 
natural areas.

<div class="comment">Sounds just like most of the states along the east 
coast. Most of these problems are population and consumption. Where it 
is a consumption problem, any population growth magnifies it. The 
problem with people being rich is that they are able to distract and 
insulate themselves from the problems, which puts them in a state of 
denial.</div>

Hard Choices Seen in Efforts to Help Louisiana Wetlands.
</a></h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
November 20, 2005 &nbsp;
The Times-Picayune</span>
<p>
Restoring Louisiana's wetlands, or maintaining those that remain, will 
be impossible, according to the National Academy of Sciences. The time 
has come for state and local governments, businesses and citizens to 
start talking about which wetland areas can be preserved and which must 
be abandoned. The proposal put forward by the state and the Army Corps 
of Engineers had worthwhile elements but would not come close to halting
 wetland loss. The panel considered an area of about 12,000 square miles
 from Texas to Mississippi. Wetlands support fishing in the Gulf of 
Mexico, much of the nation's oil and gas production, a growing 
eco-tourism industry and Louisiana's Cajun culture. But since the 
1930's, 1,900 square miles of marsh has been lost beneath the waters of 
the gulf. Many consider the wetlands a major defense against storms like
 Katrina, an idea panel members discounted. Marshes may dampen the 
effects of minor storms, but for Katrina it would not have made any 
difference. The panel was charged with evaluating a proposal developed 
after the White House complained that the 30-year, $13 billion Louisiana
 Coastal Area study, was too large, cost too much and looked too far 
into the future. The revised proposal, comprises five projects, with an 
estimated cost of $1.9 billion, that could get under way in 5 to 10 
years. The Corps of Engineers said the narrow time frame was a response 
to the Bush administration, and there was wide agreement in the corps 
that you need to think where you go long term. The projects are: an 
embankment along the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet, a canal from the 
river at New Orleans southeast to the gulf;  levee culverts to carry 
river water into the Maurepas Swamp, and three projects south of New 
Orleans, a river diversion to support wetlands in the Barataria Basin, 
improvements to channel banks, weirs and pumps along Bayou Lafourche and
 a project to rebuild beaches, dunes and marshes near Port Fourchon. The
 canal is reviled as having accelerated marsh loss but panel members 
said that this could not be demonstrated but it would be a mistake to 
reinforce the canal before the corps decides whether to decommission it.
 The panel said the other projects are scientifically sound, but 
estimated that in aggregate they would slow marsh loss by only 20%. 
Wetland loss peaked in the early 1980's, when Louisiana lost about 40 
square miles a year. Its annual loss now is 12 to 20 square miles.

US Louisina: Unnatural Disaster: the Lessons of Katrina.
</h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
September 02, 2005 &nbsp;
Worldwatch News</span>
<p>
The overwhelming impacts of Hurricane Katrina are evidence that we have 
failed to account for our dependence on a healthy resource base. 
Alteration of the Mississippi River and the destruction of wetlands have
 left the area around New Orleans vulnerable to the forces of nature. 
The early results of global warming in the Gulf and rising sea levels 
may have exacerbated the destructive power of Katrina. The catastrophe 
is a wake-up call for decision makers around the globe. Future 
generations may face disasters that make Katrina-scale catastrophes a 
common feature in the 21st century. This will likely be the most 
expensive weather-related disaster the world has ever faced. The 
long-term lessons of Katrina include: 1. Maintaining the integrity of 
natural ecosystems. Indiscriminate development and ecologically 
destructive policies have left many communities vulnerable to disasters.
 Together with population growth this has contributed to economic losses
 from weather-related catastrophes totaling $567 billion over the last 
10 years. During the past years, the US has diverted funding from 
disaster preparedness to help finance the Iraq War, and reduced 
protections for wetlands to spur economic development. Both decisions 
are now exacting costs that far exceed the money saved. Natural 
ecosystems such as wetlands and forests are more valuable when left 
intact. The links between climate change and weather-related 
catastrophes need to be addressed. No specific storm can be linked to 
climate change, but warm water is the fuel that increases the intensity 
of such storms and seas have increased in temperature. In the next few 
decades, water temperatures and sea levels will continue to rise, 
increasing the vulnerability of many communities. There is an urgent 
need to diversify energy supplies as the national and global economic 
impact of Katrina is growing by the day. The world dependent is on oil 
and natural gas that are concentrated in some of the world's most 
vulnerable regions. Biofuels and renewable resources represent viable 
alternatives to fossil fuels.

U.S.: OCS with Offshore LNG Coming to a Coast Near You.
</h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
April 2005 &nbsp;
</span>
<p>
A controversial bill from last Congress that expands the authority of 
the Department of Interior (DOI) to approve drilling rigs, liquefied 
natural gas (LNG) facilities and other offshore energy projects has 
reemerged. Critics say it would undermine environmental reviews and by 
granting the DOI prime authority, while proponents say the move is 
necessary to streamline the permitting process and boost domestic 
production. The provision, if enacted, vests the DOI with the authority 
to grant right-of-way on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) for energy 
and related purposes. It grants this authority in a more narrow area of 
the OCS instead of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) that reaches 200 
nautical miles from the coastline. The bill also allows the use of 
floating production, storage and offloading system that consists of 
tankers which store crude oil as it is produced. Smaller shuttle tankers
 carry the oil ashore. This is opposed by environmentalists and was not 
in last session's bill. The measure gave DOI primacy over expedited 
approval of LNG processing facilities, conversion of offshore oil 
platforms to new uses, seabed petroleum pipelines, and offshore wind and
 wave energy installations. Currently, the authority is dispersed among 
Coast Guard for offshore LNG terminals and the Army Corps of Engineers 
for offshore wind projects. DOI has permitting authority only over  oil 
and gas exploration offshore. According to  congressional sources, 
several prominent Democrats were expected to offer amendments to strip 
the language from the bill before negotiations collapsed. It is unclear 
if the measure will be included in a Senate version of the energy bill 
this Congress, but it will be opposed by coastal state lawmakers from 
both parties. Environmentalists say there is a need for a new licensing 
regime that would permit offshore energy projects.

Center for Biological Diversity Announces Support for Global Population 
Speak Out.
</a></h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
February 26, 2009 &nbsp;
Center for Biological Diversity</span>
<p>
The Center for Biological Diversity supports a collaborative effort to 
highlight overpopulation in efforts to restore the planet's ecological 
health. For many years human population size and growth has been the 
elephant in the room. Overpopulation is at the root of virtually all of 
the ecological threats facing our planet. Species extinction, pollution,
 resource depletion, and climate change can all be traced back to 
unsustainable population growth.</p>

<p><img src="mauvepg2.php_files/population_vs_extinction.html" 
align="top" width="410" height="390">
<!--- USGS -->
The Center has won protection for more than 350 species and hundreds of 
millions of acres of habitat. But that could be overwhelmed as too many 
people compete for too few resources and create too many burdens for 
ecosystems. The correlation between human population growth and species 
extinction has been clearly documented. </p>

<p>Humans use up to 40% of the world's Net Primary Productivity, a 
measure of energy from the sun that is converted into life-sustaining 
resources by photosynthesis. A range of extinctions can be tied directly
 to the energy, housing, food, and other resource demands of our 
population. The extinction crisis threatens to grow exponentially with 
climate change, and energy demands of a rapidly growing global populace.

U.S.: Envisioning a Sustainable Chesapeake.
</a></h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
February 17, 2008 &nbsp;
Annapolis Capital</span>
<p>
It's been most inspiring to see discussions begin to address the future 
of Maryland and the Chesapeake Bay.</p>

<p>They prompt us to ask: "What does a sustainable Chesapeake really 
mean?"</p>

<p>My vision is built upon a balanced, vibrant ecosystem teeming with 
fish, shellfish, underwater grasses and clear, healthy waters. But to be
 truly sustainable, the Chesapeake ecosystem needs to exist while also 
supporting the region's human population.</p>

<p>Creating a sustainable Chesapeake will not be easy. But as we look 
around the state, we're seeing more and more positive steps being taken.</p>

<p>Recently, the Maryland Commission on Climate Change made 
recommendations aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and 
conserving energy throughout the state. These actions will require that 
we reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by more than 25% within the next 
12 years.</p>

<p>An initiative was introduced that will seek to instill a sense of 
environmental stewardship among the 28,000 students graduating each 
year. It will also foster research and prepare the new "green" 
workforce.</p>

<p>By changing our own actions, each of us has the ability to reduce our
 impact on the bay and the planet.</p>

<p>As long as the region's population continues to grow, and we develop 
lands faster than needed to accommodate that growth, we make it more 
difficult to maintain the sustainability equation.</p>

<p>We have struggled more than 20 years to reduce the amount of 
pollution flowing into the bay and we are still far from where we need 
to be. Another 10, 20 or 30 years of pollution-fighting efforts will 
still not be enough. Bay restoration efforts will be needed in 
perpetuity.</p>

<p>We need to manage for sustainability by remaining aware of what will 
cross our path in the future.

Tree Huggers Embrace Eco-Friendly Logging.

Los Angeles Times</span>
<p>
The Conservation Fund, a 21-year-old Arlington, Va.-based organization, 
strives to balance natural resource protection with economic goals. 
Timber sales will be used to pay for forest and watershed restoration.</p>

<p>The Conservation Fund is banking on transforming the sustainable 
production and sale of timber that has grown back on previously logged 
land into dollars that can be used to permanently shield the property 
from development while improving wildlife habitat and providing jobs.</p>

<p>After buying 24,000 acres along the Garcia for $18 million in 2004, 
the Conservation Fund is purchasing an additional 16,000 acres in two 
nearby watersheds for $48.5 million, mostly with state financing. And 
the group hopes to buy 165,000 acres more, which would make it one of 
the biggest timber concerns on the North Coast.</p>

<p>Private forest ownership is held by half a dozen companies and 
families, but is struggling, with land values rising. We are talking 
about very low density…development but it alters the ecosystem. Lots of 
animals do not like dogs, cats, horses and cars coming in and out all 
the time and the land still provides valuable habitat for wildlife.</p>

<p>Financially stretched government agencies often cannot afford to make
 large-scale acquisitions to create parkland.</p>

<p>Two years ago, the organization bought the Garcia lands for $18 
million in partnership with the state Coastal Conservancy, the Wildlife 
Conservation Board and the nonprofit Nature Conservancy.</p>

<p>Now the Conservation Fund has designated 35% of the property as 
forest reserve. On the rest, it plans to continue commercial timber 
production. Foresters say this would promote sustainable forestry, but 
it is hard to get society to accept this notion. The land has been 
logged repeatedly, and most trees are less than 2 feet in diameter. The 
key, said forester Craig Blencowe, is "cut less than you grow and leave 
good trees."</p>

<p>The problem is the strategy might not produce enough timber to cover 
annual operating costs.</p>

<p>When a plan was submitted to the state for logging a few hundred 
acres, local environmentalists questioned the proposed use of herbicides
 to kill tan oaks that have taken over previously logged areas.</p>

<p>The proposal was withdrawn for revisions and herbicides will not be 
used.</p>

<p>But forest activists applaud the Conservation Fund's responsiveness 
and its decision to run a working forest rather than a park, partly 
because the region needs the jobs.</p>

<p>The Conservation Fund hopes to close a $48.5-million deal with 
Hawthorne Timber Co to acquire 11,600 acres in the Big River watershed 
and 4,345 acres in the Salmon Creek watershed.</p>

<p>The state water board recently approved a $25-million loan for the 
project. 
The Conservation Fund wants the property because it provides habitat for
 endangered species and is vulnerable to development.

Florida's biggest-ever land purchase, 74,000 acres of wild land bought 
by the state for over $350 million, comes with a catch, 17,000 acres of 
adjoining property will belong to developer Syd Kitson, who plans to 
build a new city. The purchase will preserve about 80% of the Babcock 
Ranch in the southwest of the state. It will create a corridor for 
wildlife, from Lake Okeechobee nearly to the Gulf of Mexico. Other green
 groups lament the development which clears the way for a new community 
with 19,500 homes, 6 million square feet of office space, and potential 
for 50,000 residents. The Sierra Club sued to stop the purchase, but

US Florida: Overpopulation is the Real Culprit.
</h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
January 21, 2006 &nbsp;
Detroit Free Press.  Sports Section</span>
<p>
Overpopulation is the culprit. Fishing was still going pretty strong in 
the late 1960s when lots of fish could be caught by trolling in Tampa 
Bay. But it had all gone to hell by 1980. Mackerel stocks had collapsed,
 and redfish were decimated. For a long time, like many people concerned
 with the environment, I was convinced the problem was habitat 
destruction and overexploitation. If we could just convince people to 
use less of the resources and preserve as much habitat as we could, 
things would work out. But the environmental messes we see all around us
 are only symptoms of the real cause, way too many people in many parts 
of the country, and a looming tidal wave of overpopulation that 
threatens to swamp any hope that our great-grandchildren will be enjoy 
the kind of outdoors pursuits we do. Florida's population is nearing 20 
million, and some projections say it will double in 20 years. The 
Michigan Department of Natural Resources is having an awful time trying 
to manage the state deer herd, but the problem doesn't lie with the 
deer. The problem is that when you have roughly 800,000 deer hunters, 
all of whom want a good chance to kill a deer, you can't satisfy the 
demand and still maintain a deer herd in line with what the habitat will
 support. Trying to preserve habitat and stop pollution is a losing 
battle with the kind of population growth America is experiencing. Some 
projections that the U.S. population will double to more than 600 
million in 100 years. Do you think we could continue to maintain the 
kind of wildlife habitat we have now will the best efforts at 
controlling air and water pollution do more than slow the rate of 
degradation? The issue of population growth and its effects on the 
natural world will become more important with every passing year.

U.S.: Suit Challenges Roadless Repeal.
</a></h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
September 11, 2005 &nbsp;
Los Angeles Times</span>
<p>
Gov. Ted Kulongoski sued the government for abandoning protections that 
had barred roads and logging in nearly 2 million acres of Oregon 
national forests.</p>

<p>He argued that building roads in areas that have escaped development 
would undermine the water quality and wildlife. Kulongoski, a Democrat, 
joined with the attorneys general of California and New Mexico in the 
lawsuit. It asks a federal court to reinstate safeguards the Clinton 
administration had applied to roadless acres nationally.  The lawsuit is
 a blow to the administration, which had billed its approach as friendly
 to the states and wants governors to submit petitions specifying which 
lands in their states should be protected. Kulongoski said the 
government created a frustrating and uncertain procedure, forcing him to
 repeat work done by the U.S. Forest Service. He said it keeps us from 
addressing larger issues of forest policy and he would not submit a 
petition as called for. Instead, he will ask officials to provide states
 a simpler and more certain way of returning protection to the roadless 
lands. Also, he said he would work through the Oregon Department of 
Forestry to make the state a partner in the revision of national forest 
management plans. The governor wants addressed the unpredictable logging
 levels on federal lands and the buildup of flammable tinder. Washington
 Gov. Christine Gregoire did not join the lawsuit but would be pleased 
to see it succeed. She is trying an approach with the Forest Service to 
protect most of the forest land. Under the Bush plan, states electing 
not to file petitions for protections leave roadless areas open to some 
development. The administration is providing temporary protection for 
roadless areas while working with states to address lands in each state.
 An earlier lawsuit had overturned the Clinton protections. Oregon 
loggers suggested Kulongoski was motivated by politics and  national 
forest decisions should be made locally.  There is no drive to develop 
roadless lands, and about 24 million acres would remain undeveloped 
under local forest blueprints. The debate has grown into a symbolic 
choice over the last pristine places.  The lawsuit contends the Bush 
administration illegally reversed the 2001 roadless safeguards without 
considering the environmental consequences.  The Clinton administration 
justified the forest protections by saying they were needed to stop 
activities that pose risks to the social and ecological values of 
roadless lands. The Forest Service held public meetings and received

not petition the administration to protect all roadless lands in Oregon.

Out on a Limb - Experts Sound An Alarm, Saying Development is Swallowing
 30,000 Acres of Forest and Woodlands Annually in California .
</a></h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
June 07, 2005 &nbsp;
</span>
<p>
Sixty years after Edwards' father bought 520 acres of forest east of 
Sacramento, the son struggles to keep it from being overrun by homes. 
30,000 acres of private forests and woodlands are swallowed by 
development each year. Experts predict that California will lose 1 
million acres of forest and woodlands, 8% of its 12.2 million-acre 
total, to development by 2040. As housing prices rise, Californians are 
willing to pay more for home sites than the land is worth in timber. 
Private forest owners say they are tempted to sell to developers because
 log prices have dropped 38% to an average $292 per thousand board feet.
 The value of California's wood harvests has fallen from $1.1 billion in
 1994 to $500 million last year. Some advocacy groups acknowledge that 
timber-cutting rules meant to protect forests, rivers and water are one 
factor conspiring to bring development and its pollution threats. More 
people moving into forests results in declining populations of birds and
 animals, new pests and tree diseases, more air pollution and watershed 
erosion. The harvest plans tell foresters where not to cut timber and 
some counties, have their own stricter rules. About 5.4 million acres of
 private forestland are in a Timberland Production Zone, in which an 
owner agrees not to sell for development for 10 years in exchange for 
property taxes based on timber value rather than residential value. But 
counties can allow large-lot parcel splits as long as the parcels remain
 a working forest. Rural residential zoning could allow anywhere from 
one home per acre to one home per 40 acres. Some new ideas include: 
promote "California Grown" wood, conservation easements that restrict 
logging while keeping forests free of development.

U.S.: Upside of a Recession.
</a></h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
January 2010 &nbsp;
News and Review,  Sacramento California</span>
<p>
Except for the 15.4 million Americans unemployed—up from 7.5 million two
 years ago—and the 7.1 million properties foreclosed since January 2008,
 the recession has done a ton of positive stuff.</p>

<p>The recession is good for the environment. It must be because the 
California Air Resources Board said so at a seven-hour hearing on diesel
 emissions standards in early December.</p>

<p>Air quality has improved because of the recession, a stagnant housing
 market sharply reduces the noxious fumes being belched into the 
atmosphere by cement mixers, heavy trucks and earth-moving equipment.</p>

<p>The closure of several major retailers, as well as numerous smaller 
businesses, reduces carbon-dioxide emissions. Empty, darkened retail 
space also reduces energy consumption and costs.</p>

<p>The recession has also been a boon for natural resources. If no 
houses are built, the land stays dirt and grass, nurturing a vast, 
circle-of-life ecosystem in which flora and fauna thrive.</p>

<p>Here's an air-quality-habitat conservation two-fer: demand is now 
reduced for a slew of products whose creation harms the environment. 
Consider this: If fewer houses are being built, there's less need for 
wood framing. Ergo, fewer trees are felled and continue to proudly 
stand, sequestering carbon dioxide. Where's the banner headline?</p>

<p>So when the naysayers prattle about the recession's horrors, 
recognize they are simply looking through the wrong end of the 
telescope.

<div class="comment">Karen Gaia says: another upside: people are having 
fewer children and immigrants are returning to their homeland. But there
 are environmental downsides overlooked: I can see people cutting down 
trees and poaching wildlife to survive. And degradation of the soil and 
overpumping of wells will continue until the population declines. 
Pesticides may be up if soil is poorer - to continue to feed the many 
mouths.</div>

Economic Scene: is Population Growth a Ponzi Scheme?.
</a></h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
August 17, 2009 &nbsp;
Christian Science Monitor</span>
<p>
Forty-five nations worry about the costs of supporting an aging society 
and the loss of national and economic power.</p>

<p>But notions that population growth is a boon for prosperity are 
"Ponzi demography," says Joseph Chamie, former director of the 
population division of the UN.</p>

<p>By 2050, countries as diverse as Cuba, Georgia, Germany, Hungary, 
Japan, South Korea, and Russia will lose at least 10% of their people, 
the UN estimates.</p>

<p>In the rich, developed nations, the average age is rising at the 
fastest pace. Today they have 264 million aged 60 or over. By 2050, that
 number is expected to rise to 416 million.</p>

<p>By that time, the world's population should stabilize. Some nations 
are fighting back for families to have more children. The US is bucking 
the trend with its relatively high immigration rate.</p>

<p>Growth, for business, means a boost in the demand for products and 
also a surge in low- and high-skilled workers, which keep a lid on 
wages. Religious and ethnic groups want more immigrants of their own 
faith and ethnicity to raise their political and social clout. The 
military regards young immigrants as potential recruits.</p>

<p>But the public pays for a bigger population with more congestion on 
highways, more farmland turned into housing developments, more 
environmental damage, including the output of pollutants associated with
 climate change.</p>

<p>In the US, one costly question is whether insurance covers some 11 
million illegal immigrants.</p>

<p>There are also costs for countries with stable or declining 
populations.</p>

<p>They will need to spend more looking after older citizens and, some 
industries, like housing, will shrink.</p>

<p>Raising the average retirement age does far more to increase the 
working population than increasing immigration levels. Industrial 
nations with large service industries have plenty of employment 
opportunities for seniors, as opposed to poor countries where many jobs,
 say planting crops, are hard work.</p>

<p>The costs of an aging but stable population would be more manageable 
than those of a population boom.</p>

<p>Does America need more than its current 309 million people? A stable 
or falling population, is a success.

Energy Use, CO2 Emission and Immigration.
</a></h4>
<span class="smallfont">

</span>
<p>
U.S. energy consumption and the resulting environmental impact of the 
production of greenhouse gasses has been steadily increasing in total 
amounts even though per capita consumption has been decreasing. U.S. 
energy consumption increased by about 34% from 1973 to 2007. Over this 
same period, per capita energy consumption decreased by 6.4%. The reason
 for the increase in energy consumption is due to the 43.1% increase in 
the U.S. population.</p>

<p>Between 1974 and 2007 legal immigration accounted for 31.5% of the 
U.S. population increase; adding illegal immigration and the children 
born
to the immigrants after their arrival, the share of population growth 
attributable to immigration is still higher. During this period, the 
entire 44.7% increase in residential energy use was entirely a factor of
 population growth.

<div class="comment">Karen Gaia says: Why does the author overlook the 
large numbers of unintended pregnancies in the U.S.? If these were 
prevented or aborted, population growth would slow considerably, as it 
has in European countries where fertility rates are around 1.2 - 1.8. 
The article could just as well be named: "Energy Use, CO2 Emission and

U.S.: Hold Steady.
</h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
June 09, 2009 &nbsp;
Earth Island Journal</span>
<p>
If we don't stabilize population growth, life as we know it is unlikely 
to continue. With so many of us burning fossil fuels, gobbling up 
renewable resources, and generating toxic trash, our life support 
ecosystems are threatened.</p>

<p>In the central North Pacific Ocean gyre, swirling plastic fragments 
now outweigh plankton 46 to one.  CO2 in the atmosphere is higher today 
than anytime in the past 650,000 years. Nearly one in four mammals is 
threatened with extinction, and worse - one in three amphibians and a 
quarter of all conifers. In many parts of the world, including the High 
Plains of North America, human water use exceeds annual average water 
replenishment; by 2025  1.8 billion people will be living in regions 
with absolute water scarcity, according to the UN. Unsustainable farming
 practices cause the destruction and abandonment of almost 30 million 
acres of arable land each year. </p>

<p>The number of humans is still increasing by 1.18% per year, or 80 
million annually, the equivalent of nearly two Sudans, or three and a 
half Taiwans. Even though China is only growing by 0.5% annually, it is 
still growing by eight million people each year. The US, with a 1% 
population grow rate, increases by more than 2.9 million people 
annually, </p>

<p>the equivalent of almost four new San Franciscos.</p>

<p>Many argue that a decrease in human numbers would lead to a fiscal 
catastrophe, seeing that, in the last 200 years, </p>

<p>unprecedented economic growth has been accompanied by an equally 
unprecedented increase in world population. During the 1800s and 1900s, 
up to half of world economic growth was likely due to population growth;
 Georgetown University environmental historian John McNeill explains: "A
 big part of economic growth to date consists of population growth. </p>

<p>More hands, more work, more things produced."</p>

<p>Gross Domestic Product (GDP), a measure of economic success or 
failure, is the number of people multiplied by per capita income. Slow 
population growth, and economic growth will likely slow as well unless 
advances in productivity and spending increase at rates high enough to 
make up the difference. This perhaps explains why population policy is 
not a popular issue.</p>

<p>Instead We should be looking at per capita GDP, which corrects for 
population growth. While Japan's economy has been touted as 'bad', based
 on its national GDP it has actually enjoyed the biggest gain in average
 income among the big three rich economies. GDP is 'bad' only because 
its population is shrinking. Population decline may slow economic growth
 on a nationwide basis, "but it would not necessarily reduce per capita 
wealth or, indeed, per capita growth."</p>

<p>Nicholas Eberstadt, a political economist at the American Enterprise 
Institute, suggests "an orderly and relatively slow reduction in 
population, and not a chaotic plunge in our numbers as a result of war, 
disease, a breakdown in healthcare systems, or natural catastrophe." 
What is necessary is to match low death rates with low birthrates.</p>

<p>Daniel O'Neill of the Center for the Advancement of a Steady State 
Economy says: "t this point in history, having too many people, or too 
high a level of consumption, is much more likely to result in the end of
 economic progress, via ecological collapse, than having too few." The 
costs of economic growth in the U.S. began to exceed the benefits 
sometime in the late 1970s.</p>

<p>An economic "slowdown" that results from slowing and eliminating 
population growth is distinctly different from that caused by a credit 
crunch or the messy bursting of a speculative bubble. While it's true 
there will be fewer mouths to feed, there will also be fewer pairs of 
hands needing employment. In many poorer nations, having more children 
means increasing the supply of labor, and lowering wages.</p>

<p>Unfortunately,'GDP' does not differentiate between costs and benefits
 and we end up spending more money to fix the problems caused by 
population growth. The costs of mitigating the stress imposed by a 
ballooning population on roads, schools, parks, agricultural land, air 
and water quality, government services, and ecosystems add to the total 
pool of a country's economic transactions. </p>

<p>"Sure, population decline will slow down aggregate demand. On the 
other hand, it's going to increase the amount of resources per capita," 
Daly says.</p>

<p>While reducing population growth in an orderly fashion promises more 
economic good than ill, it will bring about social and economic 
challenges that even proponents of shrinking the population do not 
dismiss lightly. Of particular concern are the challenges associated 
with reducing the number of working age people relative to retirees.</p>

<p>If we have fewer people, we will be spared the problems caused by 
overpopulation, save on natural resources, and in the long run be more 
able to provide for the social security of our aging population.

Interview with Albert Bartlett: "Arithmetic, Population, and Energy" – 
Puzzling Growth Rates.
</a></h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
January 15, 2009 &nbsp;
GuruFocus.com</span>
<p>
Albert Bartlet, Emeritus Professor of Physics at the University of 
Colorado at Boulder, has given his lecture <i>Arithmetic, Population, 
and Energy</i> over 1,600 times since September, 1969. He says that 
people didn't understand the large numbers that result from steady 
growth rates.</p>

<p>The business of promoters, builders and architects is promoting 
growth. But growth doesn't pay for itself, not at the community level or
 national level. The more you grow the greater your debt load. Colorado 
has had decades of wild and largely uncontrolled growth and is now 
practically bankrupt. </p>

<p>People don't like the constant increases in taxes needed to pay the 
costs of growth and they vote for tax limitation measures. Then the 
growth promoters to find ways around these limitations, so the growth 
continues and the consequent problems escalate rapidly. This happens in 
California as well as in Colorado.</p>

<p>From a book "Better Not Bigger", Eben Fodor wrote that every new 
house built in Oregon costs the Oregon taxpayer something in the order 
of $25,000 in costs not paid by taxes on the construction of the home 
itself.</p>

<p>Utilities are now fighting for the right to tax customers for the 
costs of planning and construction. The investors should be required to 
bear these responsibilities, and when the plant was finished you could 
figure the cost into the rate system- so that the people that built it 
would be reimbursed. State regulators are allowing utilities to charge 
payers for planning costs- even if it isn't clear that the plants need 
to be built. This is a perpetual growth promoting situation.</p>

<p>Investors need to realize that there's a time to grow, but as some 
point, any further growth is detrimental.</p>

<p>In Bartlett's book titled, "The Essential Exponential for the Future 
of our Planet,"  overpopulation raises the number of constituents per 
elected official, making it harder for individuals to gain access to 
representatives and have a voice in politics. Also, overpopulation 
breeds more government regulation to cope with problems caused by 
population pressure.</p>

<p>In the 1990's the US population grew by 13.1%, while the number of 
members in the House of Representatives didn't grow at all; another way 
of saying that democracy declined by 13.1%.</p>

<p>With the number of constituents per representatives multipling, it's 
much easier as a politician to take your ideas from the lobbyist who has
 plenty of money.</p>

<p>The terms "sustainable" and "sustainability" are popularly used to 
describe "activities that are ecologically laudable," but unsustainable.
 How can the reader decide whether publications are seeking to 
illuminate or obfuscate? </p>

<p>Both smart growth and dumb growth destroy the environment. The only 
difference is that smart growth destroys the environment with good 
taste. </p>

<p>In Al Gore's book &amp; film, "An Inconvenient Truth," Gore never 
mentions curbing population growth. This is a silent lie, very 
discouraging.</p>

<p>Those who profit from (uneconomic)growth will use their considerable 
resources to convince the community that the community should pay the 
costs of growth. </p>

<p>The Tragedy of the Commons relates to things like the world's 
fisheries a type of "commons". This is tragic for local fishermen who 
have lived off the oceans for centuries.</p>

<p>The economist, Kenneth Boulding, is known for saying "Anyone who 
thinks that steady growth can continue indefinitely, is either a madman 
or an economist." 
Boulding's Three Laws are "The Dismal Theorem" : If the only ultimate 
check on the growth of population is misery, then the population will 
grow until it is miserable enough to stop its growth; "The Utterly 
Dismal Theorem" : any technical improvement can only relieve misery for a
 while, for so long as misery is the only check on population, the 
improvement will enable population to grow, and will soon enable more 
people to live in misery than before. The final result of  improvements,
 therefore, is to increase the equilibrium population which is to 
increase the total sum of human misery; "The moderately cheerful form of
 the Dismal Theorem" : If something else, other than misery and 
starvation, can be found which will keep a prosperous population in 
check, the population does not have to grow until it is miserable and 
starves, and it can be stably prosperous. </p>

<p>The last US president that worried about population was Richard 
Nixon. He charted a major study called "The Rockefeller Commission 
Report." The conclusion was that they couldn't see any benefit to 
further population growth in the US. The study was put on the shelf and 
forgotten.</p>

<p>Bartlett says that Malthus presents population problems very clearly.
 Translated to today's problems, Malthus would read something like this:
 "Population growth has the potential to outstrip the growth in 
production of any of the resources that are necessary to sustain our 
population."</p>

<p>The notion of many is that science and technology will save us, so 
why worry about it? A state senator once said to Bartlett, "I'm not 
worried about running out of petroleum, you (pointing to me) scientists 
will figure out what ever we need." When asked what was the last new 
source of energy scientists found, he didn't have an answer. Innovation 
on the large scale required by our overpopulated society will take time 
and costs billions of dollars.</p>

<p>Newly created jobs in a community temporarily lowers the unemployment
 rate, but then people move into the community to restore the 
unemployment rate to its earlier higher value. For years, we have 
promoted an insane policy of exporting jobs and importing people. Any 
country that has to import people to do the work of the country is 
unsustainable. </p>

<p>Carrying capacity is a measure of how many people can be supported 
indefinitely. Sustainability requires that the size of the population be
 less than or equal to the carrying capacity of the ecosystem for the 
desired standard of living.</p>

<p>Social Security and such projects are Ponzi schemes. They depend on 
having more and more people paying every year or they collapse. </p>

<p>If you change fertility rates it can take 50-70 years before you see 
the full effects of a change in fertility. This is called population 
momentum which is a mismatch to our democracy. Politicians implement 
changes that benefit us in the short term over the long term.</p>

<p>David Pimentel, a global agricultural scientist at Cornell University
 says that a sustainable world population living at current US dietary 
level would consist of two billion people. Also, he suggests that a 
sustainable US population at current dietary levels would have to be 
around 130-150 million people, which is the population of the US around 
World War II.</p>

<p>The key is to make family planning available widely throughout the US
 and the world - with the goal that every child is a wanted child.</p>

<p>With increased growth you have to provide police, fire, schools, 
waste removal, clean water, and a variety of other infrastructure 
projects. These services aren't paid for by growth. Schools, for 
example, get their operating expenses from the taxes and to get capital 
expenses they have to issue bonds. Thus, all tax payers have to pay 
higher taxes to accommodate schools for new kids.</p>

<p>The solution is to tax growth, put a tax on real estate transactions 
and use this tax to fund new projects.</p>

<p>Economists think of infinite substitutability. They cite the shifting
 out of whale oil to petroleum or from wood to coal. We already know the
 substitutes that exist are very costly to access. </p>

<p>Growth never pays for itself. Now the federal government is paying 
for state schools, highways, sewage systems, bridges. This has happened 
because the local economy can't support local population growth.</p>

<p>But inflation is a tax on everyone; if the federal government issues 
bonds to pay for the consequences of growth (infrastructure, etc) this 
is likely to result in inflation. Looking at our national debt levels, 
the inflation could be very severe.</p>

<p>The US population growth rate is the highest of any industrial 
nation.

<div class="comment">Karen Gaia says: Prof Bartlett is very good at 
stating the problem, but needs to expand on the solutions since many 
people are queasy about the China solution. Bartlett needs to tell how 
the U.S. lowered its fertility rate from 4.0 in the 1960s, to around 2 
in the 1980s - all voluntarily, once modern contraception became 
available.</div>

The core demographic for consumption is the age group entering their 
prime in terms of income. The distribution of consumer spending reflects
 a bell-shaped curve in which the middle-aged demographic represents the
 largest income brackets. As a rise in the rate of change in consumer 
spending increases with the higher earning income's relative population,
 so too does the stock market which reflects a rise in GDP. Japan's post
 WWII baby boom crested in 1990, and Japan's Nikkei 225 index peaked. 
Since the baby boom in 1990, Japan has suffered from a rising retiree 
population and a deceleration of consumption spending as the higher 
income earners retired and the lower income earners grew in relative 
numbers. The bottom of the Nikkei 225 also coincided with the trough in 
the relative population ratio of the 35-49 year old to 20-34 year old 
groups. </p>

<p>This ratio between the higher wage earner and spender (35-49) 
relative to the lower wage earner and spender (20-34) relating to 
aggregate consumption and stock prices has also played out in the U.S. .
 Peaks in the relative population demographic coinciding with peaks in 
real stock prices (S&amp;P 500). Rising real stock prices are associated
 with rising relative population ratios of the higher wage earner 
relative to the lower wage earner.</p>

<p>While there is a positive relationship between productivity and 
relative population demographics, there is a negative relationship 
between productivity and inflation. We can infer that there is a 
negative relationship between inflation trends and relative demographic 
trends with productivity trends providing the associating link. We can 
look at what the future may hold. The relative demographic ratio peaked 
in 2000 and was coincident with the real S&amp;P 500 peak, and does not 
bottom until 2015. The conclusion is that the secular bear market we 
entered back in 2000 will not likely end until roughly 2015, and the 
secular inflationary trend that began in 2003 will be in place until 
2015 as well.

 and resource depletion will continue. It is foolish to think that there

Change is always difficult but our culture must change if it is to 
continue.  </p>

<p>There is a movement that is coming from the people/citizens.  It has 
been given a title of Green but I prefer Sustainable. Basically it is 
change  from a high consumption rate  to living within the capacity of 
our habitat.  Resources are being depleted as corporations push us to 
buy, buy, buy.</p>

<p>When the price of gasoline went up American moved in the direction of
 using less gas. This worried the oil corporations so the price came 
down.  In  Europe where the price of gas  is about $10. per gallon they 
walk, ride their bicycles,  use  bus and trains, have tiny 
vehicles----many not using any gasoline at all.  Hummers SUVs &amp; 
gas-guzzlers don't even exist in Europe----here they are no longer 
selling. </p>

<p>Hybrids can not be made fast enough as demand is so high.</p>

<p>The monster houses being built locally and priced at $750,000 and up 
 are  not selling. People want small, sustainable, affordable homes. </p>

<p>Bush's 700 billion "bailout" with taxpayer money is designed to 
continue the monster mansion industry. </p>

<p>Our culture must move in the direction of  what many are already 
doing. I have attempted to become independent of outside energy sources.
 I live on one acre. The sun shines on this one acre on which I grow 
bushes &amp; trees-------birds love it. These plants capture the sun's 
energy by photosynthesis. The  plants that grow feed my goats or are 
burned in my insert fireplace to heat my home in winter. It requires a 
lot of chopping, cutting &amp; hauling but the sun is providing the 
energy---not nuclear power (Diablo). </p>

<p>The sun  shines  on my solar-panels which heat my water. Of course, 
no sun, no hot water. In summer I have plenty of hot water for my hot 
tub. In winter or rainy days I have to supplement solar heat with  
natural gas to heat  water for my hot-tub.   </p>

<p>The sun activates my photo-voltaic (PV) panels which produces  my 
electricity. There are essentially no P.V.'s or solar panels on any of 
the estimated  5,000 new houses in Nipomo ----why? </p>

<p>A clothesline dries my laundry-----not Diablo. If you don't dry your 
laundry in our abundant sun you are part of the over-consuming problem. I
 got rid of my lawn years ago as it requires a lot of water, pesticides 
and herbicides. I replaced it with native plants and friendly exotics 
which the birds love and feed my goats.</p>

<p>I attempt to  eat from my one acre. My pork comes from  homegrown 
pigs.  Visitors often ask "How can you eat an animal you've named &amp; 
raised?" It is easy &amp; delicious. My pigs have a happy life with a 
straw bed,  talked to daily and gets petted often. I avoid "factory 
raised meat" as the animals have a terrible life in small pens &amp; 
crowded conditions. I do not buy factory raised meat.</p>

<p>I have goats which provides me with plenty of delicious fresh  milk 
with no chemicals. My happy chickens live on the ground, scratch a lot 
&amp; lay more nutritious eggs than caged, factory raised hens which go 
for soup after a laying cycle. My 40 hens and 3 roosters live a long 
life and enrich my farm ambiance so very much. </p>

<p>Children enjoy visiting &amp; are welcome. The 3 roosters have names 
&amp; personalities all their own. My garden &amp; orchard do provide 
some food but production is variable. For example I get more 
blackberries than I could possibly eat for about  three weeks in early 
summer &amp; then "none". </p>

<p>Nipomo  doesn't get much rain (13 inch average/year). We are  
depleting our water supply---over-draft. Water from my inside toilets go
 to a septic system whose leach lines water my plants. Lines from my 
shower, hot tub, sink and laundry all go to water plants.  My outside 
toilet doesn't even use any water &amp; fertilizes my trees.  I enjoy 
listening to the birds &amp; seeing the sun come up. </p>

<p>The large mansions that Bush's 700 billion bailout is attempting to 
continue is the wrong direction. Small sustainable homes,  bicycles and 
consuming less is the future.  The auto industry learned the hard way  
when the SUV's, Hummers &amp; Cadillacs stopped selling. If there is to 
be a future-----sustainable living  will have to be  the emphasis. The 
bailout is an attempt of our leaders to keep us buying.   </p>

<p>If there is to be a future for America we must change  to sustainable
 living.  Our current leadership is headed us in the wrong 
direction-----democracy CAN work----speak up !! For further reading go 
to Al Gore's article in the most recent Mother Jones magazine page 38. 
Some of his comments: "The survival of the United States as we know it 
is at risk",  "...the future of human civilization is at stake",  "Were

US Corn Crop Shrinks, Smallest Stocks in 14 Yrs.
</a></h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
October 08, 2010 &nbsp;
Reuters</span>
<p>
The U.S. corn crop is likely to be far smaller than expected. The corn 
stockpile will shrink
to less than a four-week supply by next fall. The U.S. Agriculture 
Department cut its corn crop estimate 4% and soybeans 2%, based on 
conditions Oct. 1.</p>

<p>With the harvest in full swing, USDA reported a downturn in corn 
yields from Ohio to Nebraska. It pegged the average yield at 155.8 
bushels per acre, down 4% from its prior estimate. USDA cut yields by 14
 bushels an acre in Illinois, by 10 bushels an acre in Iowa, the No. 1 
state; and by 9 bushels in Nebraska.</p>

<p>On the Chicago Board of Trade, prices of corn, wheat and soybeans all
 rose by the maximum amount allowed in a day. Livestock and ethanol 
prices also rose, as did shares of fertilizer companies.</p>

<p>With high demand, the corn surplus will shrink to 902 million bushels
 by the end of
this marketing year, the smallest since 883 million bushels in 1996/97. 
The stocks-to-use ratio would be a tight 6.7%.</p>

<p>USDA's estimate of wheat end stocks, 853 million bushels, was 2% 
lower than traders expected.</p>

<p>Private consultant John Schnittker said USDA's steep reduction in 
corn yields "is almost unprecedented" and added that the stocks-to-use 
ratio "is pretty low, putting real pressure on acreage and yield next 
year."</p>

<p>The projected corn crop would still be the third-largest on record, 
and the soybean crop would be the biggest on record. Ethanol makers and 
corn growers said corn supplies will be adequate, although smaller.</p>

<p>U.S. live cattle and hog futures surged as an inducement to producers
 to fatten livestock in the face of rising feed prices.</p>

<p>Fertilizer shares also rose, with analyst Edlain Rodriguez of 
Broadpoint Glecher saying farmers will need nutrients to boost 
production. Bids for cash ethanol jumped 12 cents a gallon but there 
were no offers. Corn is the main feedstock for U.S. fuel ethanol.</p>

<p>On Sept 30, USDA said there were 1.708 billion bushels in reserve as 
this year's harvest began, far more than expected. That report ended a 
rally and knocked corn prices below $5 a bushel for a week.

U.S.;: Family Feud Why Agribusiness Giants Are Facing Off Over Corn 
Ethanol.
</a></h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
May 24, 2007 &nbsp;
Grist Magazine</span>
<p>
The rapid price increase for corn, inspired by federal policies that 
encourage transforming corn into ethanol, is jacking up food prices and 
squeezing low-income people.</p>

<p>This has given rise to a "food vs. fuel" debate. You either support 
cheap corn, and a food supply that serves the poor, or you support the 
ethanol boom, whose goal is to "break our dependence on foreign oil."</p>

<p>A report by The Wall Street Journal outlines the growing rift within 
the agribiz lobby.</p>

<p>When corn was cheap and overproduced the entire agribusiness lobby 
rallied around the ethanol cause. But now that ethanol is taking food 
from feedlots, the community has grown less friendly. Tyson has been 
complaining about corn prices. Its CEO told the Wall Street Journal that
 elevated grain prices, linked to ethanol, would add $300 million to the
 company's costs this year.</p>

<p>The National Cattlemen's Beef Association is raising its voice as 
well. It finds government intervention  and the group has demanded an 
end to government tax credits for ethanol and a cut to the import tariff
 on foreign ethanol. They are demanding free markets and free trade. The
 growing rift in the agribiz lobby is concerning the politicians who 
cater to it. Presidential hopefuls feel compelled to favor the allegedly
 fuel that's going to free us from Middle East oil, but support for 
corn-based ethanol is starting to wane.</p>

<p>Legislators continue to aid ever-increasing ethanol use, but more of 
them are capping the amount of corn that can be used. The shine is off 
corn ethanol, and its explosive growth appears to have peaked.</p>

<p>The corn-based ethanol never had a shot at significantly reducing 
petroleum use. Its energy-saving potential is thin, if not imaginary. 
The backlash plays into Tyson and its peers, who hate ethanol because it
 interferes with feeding cheap corn to confined animals.</p>

<p>Last fall, U.S. farmers scrambled to plant corn anywhere they could 
and will likely harvest the largest corn crop in U.S. history.</p>

<p>If Congress pulls back support for ethanol, the corn price will 
tumble and will mean a windfall for feedlot operators, and will likely 
spur government commodity payments to corn growers under the farm bill.</p>

<p>In essence, we're being asked to choose between low-quality food and 
low-quality fuel. We should reject both.

U.S.: We Don't Need 'Guest Workers'.
</a></h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
March 21, 2006 &nbsp;
Midwest Coalition to Reduce Immigration</span>
<p>
In 1964 Congress killed the seasonal Mexican laborers program despite 
warnings that its abolition would doom the tomato industry.  Then 
scientists developed oblong tomatoes that could be harvested by machine 
and California's tomato output has risen fivefold. Now we're being 
warned again that we need unskilled laborers from Mexico and Central 
America to relieve U.S. "labor shortages." Guest workers would mainly 
legalize today's vast inflows of illegal immigrants, with the same 
consequence: We'd be importing poverty. They generally don't go home, 
assimilation is slow and the ranks of the poor are constantly 
replenished. Since 1980 the number of Hispanics with incomes below the 
government's poverty line has risen 162%, while the number of 
non-Hispanic whites in poverty rose 3% and blacks, 9.5%. What we have 
now is a policy of creating poverty in the US while relieving it in 
Mexico. It stresses local schools, hospitals and housing and feeds 
social tensions (witness the Minutemen). Some Americans get cheap 
landscaping services but if more mowed their own lawns it wouldn't be a 
tragedy. Among immigrant Mexican and Central American workers in 2004, 
only 7% had a college degree and nearly 60% lacked a high school 
diploma. Among native-born U.S. workers, 32% had a college degree and 6%
 did not have a high school diploma.  The illegal immigrants represent 
only about 4.9% of the labor force. In no major occupation are they a 
majority. They're drawn here by wage differences, not labor "shortages."
 Most new illegal immigrants can get work by accepting wages below 
prevailing levels. Hardly anyone thinks that illegal immigrants will 
leave, but what would happen if illegal immigration stopped and wasn't 
replaced by guest workers? Some employers would raise wages to attract 
U.S. workers; others would find ways to minimize those costs. The number
 of native high school dropouts with jobs declined by 1.3 million from 
2000 to 2005. Some lost jobs to immigrants and unemployment remains high
 for some groups. Business organizations support guest worker programs -
 they like cheap labor and ignore the consequences. Why do liberals 
support a program that worsens poverty and inequality? Poor immigrant 
workers hurt the wages of unskilled Americans. We've never tried a 
policy of real barriers and strict enforcement against companies that 
hire illegal immigrants. Until that's shown to be ineffective, we 
shouldn't adopt guest worker programs that add to serious social 
problems.

US Florida: Building Push Has All Signs of a War .

<p>
Developers and one municipality want to shift Miami-Dade County's 
development boundary closer to the Everglades as developers have 
assembled land parcels outside the development zone. The debate over the
 urban boundary has competing factions: those who think of it as an 
immovable line that preserves the Everglades and the those who see a 
flexible line that should bend with a burgeoning population that needs 
affordable housing. Developers, whose bid to move the line was rejected 
two years ago, are again seeking approval. The city of Hialeah filed to 
move the line which would pave the way to build an industrial site on 
the Dade Landfill. 10 applications have been filed to move the urban 
development boundary line and the re-examination begins in April of 
every odd year. The line runs along the western and southern portions of
 the county and development outside is limited to one dwelling per five 
acres.  Central to the debate is whether the county has enough land for 
future homes and businesses.  Department of Planning and Zoning predicts
 enough land until at least 2020. But opponents said the county's stock 
of housing will be gone by 2011. Commissioners are awaiting the results 
of the $3 million South Miami-Dade Watershed Study, which includes land 
outside the UDB.

In the 1940s, Los Angeles County led the nation in farming income, now 
it leads the nation in population density. Elsewhere in California, 
about 50,000 acres of farmland vanish each year. Georgia, Ohio, and 
Texas each have had more than 150,000 acres of agricultural land 
consumed by development that is being stoked by population growth and 
the desire for more space. Average property lot sizes have doubled in 
the past two decades. According to a study by the American Farmland 
Trust, "Housing developments are encroaching on the rural West and could
 replace more than 24 million acres of ranchland by 2020. More food to 
feed more people suggests a need for more farmland and ranchland. 
Instead, both are disappearing rapidly.

<h4>

U.S. is Slashing World Food Aid Contributions; Disasters, Emergencies 
Hit Amid Budget Deficits.
</h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
December 19, 2004 &nbsp;
Baltimore Sun</span>
<p>
Demands on the US food aid program is forcing the government to cancel 
food shipments and scale back donations. The US uses its agricultural 
riches to provide half, and sometimes more, of the aid to feed the 
world's hungry. But a threefold increase in emergency food demands this 
year, a U.S. deficit and tight budget restrictions are making it 
impossible for the US to fulfill its commitments with an estimated $650 
million shortfall. The U.S. Agency for International Development USAID 
is diverting resources from long-term development programs, which 
address the health and food needs of people suffering chronic hunger. 
USAID has canceled or delayed food orders placed by humanitarian 
agencies including feeding vulnerable children, AIDS patients and health
 care for mothers and infants. Because of food aid shortfall, USAID 
postponed paying for 20 new projects and delayed payments for some 
existing programs. Food shipments might resume soon, but there may be 
cancellations or delays. Catholic Relief Services anticipates that the 
cuts will leave more than 1.5 million without food assistance and could 
leave 1.2 million children without schooling, 1.2 million mothers and 
infants without nutrition and 1.6 million farmers without farm tools. 
USAID has canceled shipments of 12,860 metric tons of food  for 
Indonesia, Eritrea and Malawi. It delayed the 85,640 metric tons to a 
dozen programs in Africa and South and Central America. American 
cutbacks have forced Save the Children to put several programs on hold 
in Africa and slash its food operations in Tajikistan, Central Asia, by 
50%. The UN has received more than 50% of its funds from the US and is 
bracing for cuts in financial support for its non-emergency operations. 
It is seeking donations from China, Russia and India. In southern 
Africa, the WFP's appeal for $171 million to feed 2.8 million people has
 generated only $11.5. Food stockpiles run out next month in Lesotho. 
There are less food aid resources in the US and huge demands because of 
Sudan. What makes this year's budget shortfall serious is its impact on 
development projects and no relief in sight. In the Bush 
administration's 2005 budget, $1.183 billion was allocated for Food for 
Peace with $468 million earmarked for emergencies and the rest for 
assistance. Earlier this month, after requests from Congress and the aid
 community, the administration released 200,000 metric tons of wheat 
from an emergency food reserve to meet increased demands in Sudan. USAID
 has a $650 million shortfall and with no clear indication of when or 
whether food shipments will resume, humanitarian agencies are making 
plans to lay off employees and to tell beneficiaries that they cannot 
expect assistance this year.

US California: Forest Service Announces 'forest with a Future' While 
Accelerating Logging in the Old Forest Areas .
</h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
January 26, 2004 &nbsp;
Sierra Club release</span>
<p>
The U.S. Forest Service announced revisions to the Sierra Nevada 
Framework - the recently developed plan to manage 11.5 million acres of 
California's Sierra Nevada forest lands. Environmentalists dubbed the 
revisions "No Tree Left Behind." The following inconsistencies exist. 
The Forest Service claims the plan will reduce the risk of fire by 
cutting large trees but logging can increase fire severity by leaving 
behind logging slash, while loss of canopy encourages the growth of 
brush and decreases humidity. The Forest Service Claims the plan will 
protect homes and communities but fails to address surface and ladder 
fuels. The Forest Service plan fails to recognize old growth and manages
 it as the rest of the forest. The plan nearly triples logging and 
allows 30 inch diameter trees to be cut. The Forest Service claims the 
plan protects meadows and streams but the revisions increase the risk of
 stream and meadow erosion. The Forest Service claims the plan reduces 
the risk to wildlife but increased logging and clear cutting will likely
 cause some species to be listed under the Endangered Species Act. The 
Forest Service claims selling large trees can offset the cost of 
removing brush and smaller trees but timber sales may carry a great cost
 in the long-term. The Forest Service claims the plan was based on 
public input and scientific analysis but no public meetings have been 
held since fall of 2002, and it contains no information that would 
warrant an overhaul of the original Plan.

US Michigan: Detroit, Green City.
</a></h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
March 30, 2008 &nbsp;
Michigan Citizen</span>
<p>
Urban planners say the best way to turn an industrial city into a green 
city may be to just leave the city be.</p>

<p>At a presentation three areas were said to become the focal points 
for future development. The most important was population density and 
building up is a great way to minimize land waste.</p>

<p>Studies show walkable cities are the goal, so developing the city 
around pedestrian traffic is another way to gain more density. Mass 
transit is vital; Detroit is without a system.</p>

<p>Mass transit means that residents without cars could have a reliable 
ride to work, there would be fewer cars, and a reduced need for parking 
and a turnaround in air quality. Light-rail stations may help attract 
investors and mixed-use buildings that house both businesses and people.
 With people come density, more transit options and a boom for economic 
development.</p>

<p>Mixed-use buildings are efficient and have proved to be places people
 want to be. Parking lots are are seldom full, they absorb money and 
resources. Traditional development leads to lower density and greater 
infrastructure costs. These practices are not economically feasible. 
Population density is the key to a sustainable city.</p>

<p>The third aspect to sustaining a green city is reuse and preservation
 of buildings. The carbon footprint of demolition, waste transportation,
 and rebuilding is enormous. Building preservation and adaptive reuse 
are the best ways to employ sustainability.</p>

<p>The recent emphasis on being environmentally responsible and the 
financial benefits may spark investors to build green.</p>

<p>There is increasing evidence that green buildings cost less in the 
long run, mainly through better energy and water efficiency, but also by
 reducing waste, improving indoor air quality and through lower 
operation and maintenance costs. A change in lifestyle is necessary for 
green urbanism.

USA Today: Where Will Everybody Live?.

USA Today</span>
<p>
The USA is growing faster than any other industrialized country in the 
world. The USA added 100 million people in the past 39 years and around 
2040, the population will be past 400 million.</p>

<p>The USA trails only China and India in population. Space itself isn't
 the issue. But people want water in the desert, plentiful fuel to power
 long commutes, energy to cool and heat bigger houses and clean air and 
water. How and where they live could determine how well the nation and 
the environment will handle the added population.</p>

<p>People who work on smart growth development issues say there's no way
 we can continue over the next 40-odd years without severe consequences 
to the environment. We have to find different ways to reside on the 
land. Each American occupies almost 20% more developed land (housing, 
schools, stores, roads) than 20 years ago. The rate of land consumption 
is twice the rate of population growth.</p>

<p>The major growth patterns of the past 50 years are being challenged 
by changing demographics.</p>

<p>Americans are reconsidering traditional retirement paths. More are 
eyeing downtown condos, households are smaller and townhouses more 
appealing.</p>

<p>More immigrants are arriving, increasing mass transit ridership and 
carpooling in a country where driving alone still dominates.</p>

<p>The next 100 million people will create 73 million new jobs, about 70
 million new homes and 100 billion square feet of non-residential space.
 Urban town centers that combine condos, shops and offices in 
pedestrian-friendly settings are sprouting in suburbia. Residential 
construction in downtown districts is on the rise. Areas are are 
investing billions in light-rail lines. It takes more money to heat and 
cool a big house, when you factor in the true cost including 
transportation and energy, Americans will change how they live.</p>

<p>Growth issues are manifesting themselves in traffic congestion, loss 
of open space and more water and air pollution. </p>

<p>The paper then goes on to describe in great detail some of the 
transit and building changes already under way.

A study of metropolitan areas found that the costs of one-way commutes 
of 12 to 15 miles cancel any savings on lower-priced homes.</p>

<p>People tend to focus on the price of a closer-in house compared to 
one in the outer suburbs, but they don't realize how much they're 
spending on commuting costs</p>

<p>The average cost of owning a Toyota Camry and driving it 15,000 miles
 a year works out to $7,967 according to AAA.</p>

<p>The study found that a lack of affordable housing in the Washington 
area and elsewhere forces low- to moderate-income families to live in 
outer suburbs where transportation costs are high.</p>

<p>Of the 20 fastest-growing counties in the US, 15 are located 30 miles
 or more from urban centers. Many communities have identified a lack of 
affordable housing as critical. We need to have regional solutions about
 both housing and transportation. Most people in the outer suburbs pay 
so much for transportation because they have to use their cars for 
nearly every errand.</p>

<p>The study noted that 62.1% of the U.S. metropolitan population lived 
in the suburbs in 1996, up from 55.1% in 1970.</p>

<p>The median national household income has been outpaced by housing and
 transportation costs. The data highlight a disconnect between where 
people live and work. A three-car family puts a lot of money into 
depreciating assets, instead of into mortgages and college educations.

<h4>

US Georgia: Few Willing to Tackle Georgia's Most Pressing Issue - 
Growth.
</h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
March 28, 2006 &nbsp;
Gwinnett Daily Post</span>
<p>
The most terrifying but potentially most beneficial issue facing Georgia
 is population growth. Most politicians don't like to discuss the 
population explosion - it's too complex. Georgia is having trouble 
coping. The infrastructure, from health care and education to law 
enforcement and traffic control, is breaking down. No one dares speak 
the unspeakable but runaway growth may kill us if we don't deal with it.
  State Supreme Court Justice Harris Hines outlined the challenges 
"They're talking about making I-75 23 lanes wide in a few years in Cobb 
County, and in the next 20 years, Georgia will increase its population 
by 50%." The prison population has risen from 15,200 in 1983 to 46,900 
in 2003. Recent estimates show growth is continuing at an even faster 
pace, with about 60% from new people moving into the state. Georgia, 
with 8.4 million people, has the ninth-largest population of any state. 
Georgia has 2.2 million, 28.7% blacks, highest of any state. Hispanics 
13%, Asians 2.1%. The median age for all Georgians is 33.4 and will have
 one of the fastest rates of growth of the elderly. Georgia has low 
educational attainment and income. More than 21% did not graduate from 
high school. Among blacks, 27.5% failed to finish high school. Per 
capita income is $28,523, No. 25 in the country. From 1990 to 2002, 36% 
of all Georgia births were to unwed mothers, 25% of births to white 
women were to unwed mothers, and 66% of births to black women were to 
unwed mothers. Georgia has four problems, high school dropouts, 
diabetes, substance abuse and gambling. The lawmakers take bows for 
denying some state services to hordes of illegal aliens without 
inflicting much pain on the corporate employers who induced them to come
 here.

 Water Security System, and 4) Restructuring global institutions. INM:<br>The
 major purpose of a village level socio-demographic charter is to<br>sensitise

 issues like maternal and child health care services, reproductive<br>health
 education, tuberculosis and AIDS prevention and care, provision of<br>safe

 higher enrolment in primary schools, and more education of the<br>girl

 nutritional supplementation of pregnant mothers and children under<br>five
 and to eliminating micro-nutrient deficiencies. f) Gender code: to end<br>gender
 inequity and discrimination including adverse sex ratios, inequitable<br>property
 rights, dowry, female foeticide and infanticide, higher female<br>mortality
 and morbidity, higher female illiteracy, feminisation of poverty<br>and
 food insecurity for women. The role of women in the conservation and<br>improvement
 of agrobio-diversity will be given explicit recognition. India's<br>national
 bio-diversity legislation, the Plant Variety Protection and<br>Farmers'
 Rights Act, now before Parliament, provide for recognising and<br>rewarding
 the contributions of tribal and rural families to genetic<br>resources 
conservation (biodiversity) and improvement. Community seed banks,<br>supported
 by microcredit, and grain banks operated by a self-help groups<br>need 
to be established. In the re-negotiated World Trade Agreement,<br>industrialised

Asia Must Preserve MDG Gains, Include Poor in Future Growth: ADB.
</h4>

Asia Pulse</span>
<p>
The economic crisis threatens to reverse progress in poverty reduction 
and governments must do what they can to ensure those gains are not 
lost.</p>

<p>The target year is (2015) for accomplishing the eight MDGs. Asia has 
made strong progress to cutting extreme poverty in half by 2015. 
However, the economic crisis threatens to slow the pace of further 
reduction.</p>

<p>GDP growth in 2009 for developing Asia will be 6% lower than in 2007 
and 3% lower than in 2008. As a result, around 60 million people will be
 stuck below the US$1.25 poverty line.</p>

<p>Prospects for the achievement of non-poverty related development 
goals look increasingly bleak. Many countries remain off-track on 
primary school completion rates, and access to water.</p>

<p>Questions have been raised whether infrastructure alone can cushion 
the harsh economic impacts of the crisis. Social service programs such 
as health care and education, should not be crowded out by 
infrastructure programs.

Bangladesh a Success Story in Reproductive Health.
</a></h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
July 10, 2006 &nbsp;
Daily Star</span>
<p>
Bangladesh has been a success story in population and reproductive 
health, but it still has to go a long way. People are not getting the 
right contraceptive at the right time. Bangladesh is the most densely 
populated country in the world and its population will stabilise in 2050
 when there will be nearly 24 crore (crore = 10 million) people.</p>

<p>The country has made progress but the maternal mortality rate is 
still high with 12,000 women dying from complications of pregnancy and 
childbirth annually.</p>

<p>Bangladesh has to target the poor because they are voiceless and have
 a higher total fertility rate (TFR), maternal mortality and higher 
incidence of malnutrition. The TFR among the poor has been double that 
of the rich. Women get married at an early age due to low income and 
lack of security. Half of the population lives below poverty line. Close
 links between poverty and reproductive health exist that keep the poor 
in persistent poverty. Infant mortality among the poor has come down to 
65 per 1,000 in 2004. Contraceptive prevalence increased to 58% in 2004 
from 8.5% in mid 70s.  A growing concern in Bangladesh is the 
persistence of health inequality, linked to birth attended by skilled 
health personnel.</p>

<p>More than 45% in the highest income group has access to safe delivery
 whereas in the lowest income less than 4% get this service. The first 
round of success was the reduction of fertility to 3% in 2004 from 6% in
 the mid 70s.

US Georgia: Atlanta Case Raises Questions About Water Supply.
</a></h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
March 5, 2010 &nbsp;
Forbes Magazine</span>
<p>
A federal judge ruled that Atlanta has been illegally tapping Lake 
Lanier for years as its primary water source. Unless Congress 
reclassifies the lake as a water supply, the judge ruled, Atlanta will 
be cut off by 2012.</p>

<p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which sells water from 135 federal 
reservoirs around the country, recently gave Congress a preliminary list
 of 40 projects in 14 states that were not authorized for supplying 
water but are being used for that purpose.</p>

<p>Georgia leaders are trying to rally other states as allies in 
pursuing new classification from Congress for all the Army Corps' lakes.
 But little success has been realized. At least 500,000 people in 
eastern Wisconsin rely on Winnebago for water, even though the corps has
 said that its use is not authorized.</p>

<p>In southern Kentucky, over 10,000 people rely on water from Laurel 
River Lake, which was originally built for hydropower and recreation.</p>

<p>In Atlanta, only after rapid population growth has the corps turned 
to water supply. The shift has often come on shaky legal ground.</p>

<p>Lanier serves about 3 million people.</p>

<p>The Atlanta ruling could set off a wave of new legal challenges. 
That's especially true with demands on water supplies growing and river 
systems becoming increasingly strained.

U.S.: Southeast Drought Study Ties Water Shortage to Population, Not 
Global Warming.
</h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
October 1, 2009 &nbsp;
New York Times*</span>
<p>
Research from Columbia University shows that the 2005 - 2007 drought in 
the Southeast resulted from random weather events, not global warming, 
and its severe water shortages resulted from population growth more than
 rainfall patterns.</p>

<p>The population of Georgia alone rose to 9.54 million in 2007 from 
6.48 million in 1990.</p>

<p>Richard Seager, a climate expert at the Lamont-Doherty Earth 
Observatory said "our conclusion was this drought was pretty normal and 
pretty typical by standards of what has happened in the region over the 
century".</p>

<p>Similar weather patterns can be expected regularly in the future, 
with similar results.</p>

<p>Although the 2005-7 drought was the worst in the region since the 
1950s, there have been worse droughts before.</p>

<p>Some climate models developed suggest that the Southeast will be 
wetter in a warming world. But it would be unwise to view climate change
 as a potential solution to future water shortages. As the region's 
temperature rises, there may be more rain, they wrote, but evaporation 
will increase, possibly leaving the area drier than ever.</p>

<p>Creating greater water storage capacity could mitigate drought 
effects in areas where population was rising. "If you have more people 
and the same amount of water storage, you are going to increase the 
impact of droughts."

Peak Water.
</a></h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
September 2009 &nbsp;
TheBurningPlatform.com</span>
<p>
Since the earth is 70% covered by water, and the water cycle replenishes
 water on a continuous basis, the idea of 'peak water' may seem strange 
for most people. </p>

<p>Glaciers are melting and oceans are rising, which means water will be
 more plentiful. But it is the location of the water that matters. 
Shortages in the wrong places could lead to food shortages, famine, and 
starvation in those regions, and effect the economic future of nations.</p>

<p>Many politicians have ignored resource issues for the last 30 years 
of debt- financed good times with relatively low prices for all natural 
resources and commodities. </p>

<p>Investment manager Jeremy Grantham says "We must prepare ourselves 
for waves of higher resource prices and periods of shortages unlike 
anything we have faced outside of wartime conditions."</p>

<p>Comparing peak oil to peak water: </p>

<p>While oil is non-renewable and limited, it is replaceable by other 
more costly alternatives; water is renewable and relatively unlimited, 
but there is no substitute and it is only useful in the precise places. </p>

<p>Oil is finite, while water is literally finite, but nearly unlimited 
at a cost.</p>

<p>Long-distance transport of oil is economically viable while with 
water it is not.</p>

<p>If the world's population grows from 6.7 billion people to 7.5 
billion by 2020 - a possible projection by the U.N., water use would 
increase by 40% to support the food requirements of the additional 
people. 1.8 billion people would be living in regions with extreme water
 scarcity.</p>

<p>Since the U.S. is an exporter of wheat, soybeans, rice and corn ($80 
billion worth in 2008), drought or additional consumption in the areas 
where these crops are grown would have worldwide implications.</p>

<p>70% of the globe is covered by water, but most of it is saltwater. 
Desalinization can convert saltwater into freshwater, but it is only 
useful on coastlines and is 15 times more expensive than natural 
freshwater. </p>

<p>2% of the earth's water is considered freshwater, most of which is 
locked up in glaciers, permanent snow cover and in deep groundwater. </p>

<p>Challenges of freshwater:
* Uneven distribution on the planet
* Economic and physical constraints of tapping glacial water
* Contamination of supplies
* High distribution costs</p>

<p>Regional scarcity solutions are not easy:
* Reduce demand
* Move the demand to where water is available.
* Shift to costly sources, such as desalinization.</p>

<p>In the Southwest U.S., much of it desert, solutions are difficult. 
Lake Mead, the country's largest artificial body of water, which 
provides water to Arizona, California, Nevada and northern Mexico is 
dangerously depleted. Housing developments in this region have been 
stopped by lack of water. </p>

<p>On the Colorado River there is more water allocated than there is 
water, which is not a problem as long as some people are willing to sell
 their water. For example, Chevron leases water from its shale oil 
project to the city of Las Vegas for drinking water. The day may come 
when Chevron won't extend the lease.</p>

<p>Many areas are using ground water that will be used up entirely in 
just a few decades.</p>

<p>In the U.S., suburban sprawl, with its lawns and ponds, has put 
intense pressure on local water supplies. In drought years Maryland, 
Virginia and the District fight over the Potomac water - lawns sucking 
up 85% of the river's flow. 67 million more people are expected to 
inhabit the United States by 2030, making water shortages even more 
severe.</p>

<p>In the midwest, parts of the Ogallala Aquifer - the great underground
 reservoir stretching from Texas to South Dakota - has started to run 
dry. "When you go to your house and turn the shower on and there is no 
water, it's a serious situation'" a farmer says.</p>

<p>In the last 10 years there has been a steady erosion in the amount of
 grain grown per capita. With developing countries growing rapidly, the 
need for imports of grain could drive up the cost of food everywhere. </p>

<p>The Chinese are converting farmland to industrial uses, while at the 
same time demanding more meat and grains in their diet. The price spike 
in 2007 and 2008 is a sign of a costly future for consumers. According 
to the U.N. in 2008, global food reserves were at their lowest level in 
30 years</p>

<p>We should call them peak cheap oil and peak cheap water, instead of 
just peak oil and peak water, because the cost of producing or supplying
 them will continue to rise.</p>

<p>Food shortages and skyrocketing commodity prices are inevitable, with
 peak water playing significant role. The evidence is before our eyes:
    * Droughts in key farming belt areas
    * Less snow pack in the mountains
    * Contamination of freshwater sources by industrial waste
    * Soil erosion
    * Depletion of underground aquifers
    * Higher oil prices, fertilizer costs, food transportion
    * Bio-fuels as an energy source.
    * Worldwide population growth
    * Middle class enrichment of diets worldwide.</p>

<p>We know that peak oil is the more likely trigger for armed conflict. 
 For example, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor because the U.S. was cutting 
off its oil supply. The Middle East, Russia, Brazil, Canada have the 
oil, while the United States, China, Europe, Japan need the oil. The 
struggle resulting from peak water is not yet on the radar screen, but 
is coming up.

Our Water Supply, Down the Drain.
</a></h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
August 23, 2009 &nbsp;
Washington Post</span>
<p>
In the United States, we worry about oil shortages, water is another 
important limited natural resource, in many parts of the country.</p>

<p>In 2008, the nearly 5 million people in metro Atlanta came close to 
its principal water supply drying up. The lake may no longer be used as a
 municipal supply since Alabama and Florida are contending the use of 
the water.</p>

<p>Over 30 states are fighting with neighboring states over water.</p>

<p>In Florida lakes are drying up due to groundwater depletion from 
overpumping. Low river flows in the Catawba River in South Carolina 
prevented a paper company from discharging its wastewater, resulting 
workers being furloughed. North Carolina is fighting with South Caroline
 over the water in that river. </p>

<p>Fully loaded freighters cannot float in Lake Superior, the largest of
 the Great Lakes. The Ipswich River near Boston was without water in 
five of the last eight years. In 2007, Orme, Tennessee, ran out of water
 altogether; it trucks in water from Alabama.</p>

<p>The amount of water is not the problem. It's population growth. 
California had a major drought in 1992, that hasn't stopped the state 
from adding 7 million people. Atlatnta Georgia sees 100,000 people added
 each year. The U.S. is expected to add 120 million people in the next 
four decades.</p>

<p>Suprisingly, some forms of renewable energy also present water 
problems. Refining one gallon of ethanol requires four gallons of water.
 It takes 2,500 gallons of water to grow enough corn to refine one 
gallon of ethanol.</p>

<p>Water shortages have been alleviated in the U.S. by diverting more 
from rivers, building dams or drilling groundwater wells, but now many 
of these rivers dry up each year. And we're pumping so much water from 
wells that the levels in aquifers are plummeting. We're running out of 
technological fixes.</p>

<p>Some dreamers are planning to get water from British Columbia or tow 
icebergs from Alaska, but they overlook the immense costs and 
significant environmental impacts of such grandiose proposals.</p>

<p>Solutions include desalination of ocean water, reuse of municipal 
waste and aggressive conservation strategies. Desalination and 
reclaiming waste water are both expensive, but aggressive conservation 
programs have reduced consumption dramatically. </p>

<p>But it's not enough. We need to pay for our water.

The Drought: Ecologically, Perpetual Growth is Impossible Thing.
</h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
November 15, 2008 &nbsp;
Journal-Constitution</span>
<p>
Georgia's water supply is finite, it always will be. The quantity of 
water varies depending on rainfall, but there is data to have an 
excellent idea of averages and extremes.</p>

<p>Georgia's population represents a constantly growing demand on water 
supply and quality. During extreme droughts, the conflict between an 
ever-growing population and a finite water supply becomes obvious.</p>

<p>It should be obvious, at least to those caught up in the belief that a
 viable economy demands constant growth, even though rational thought, 
should logically lead to a contrary opinion.</p>

<p>Ecologists use the term "carrying capacity" to describe how many 
plants or animals a given piece of real estate might support. Farmers 
recognize the concept, knowing that the number of cows their pastures 
will support depends on the type and quality of the forage, availability
 of water, the acceptable growth rate and other factors.</p>

<p>The concept of carrying capacity is just as applicable to humans as 
to cows. In the US, mankind has artificially extended human carrying 
capacity while maintaining a high living standard by using stored energy
 reserves from eons past and perpetual growth and improved living 
standards have become basic expectations.</p>

<p>Georgia has long used state resources to promote economic growth, 
fueled by population growth, without considering the ultimate outcome.</p>

<p>Even while announcing a lawsuit aimed at forcing the more of a finite
 regional water supply to Georgia, Gov. Sonny Perdue was on a mission to
 attract more industry to the state.</p>

<p>The sole reason when we already have full employment is to attract 
more people. More people equal a larger GDP, for which groupthink 
demands a favorable view, regardless of the effect on quality of life.</p>

<p>Georgia's population is about 9.5 million. If growth rates of the 
past dozen years are maintained, population will double to about 19 
million in just 26 years (2033) and double again to 38 million by 2059.</p>

<p>From an ecological perspective, it is imperative that we stop and 
determine what an optimum population might be. Instead, we continually 
ask ourselves to use less water, go further into debt, sit in longer 
traffic snarls and lower our living standard in various other ways so we
 can accommodate more people.</p>

<p>The ultimate irony was when Gov. Perdue asked everyone to pray for 
rain. Does he expect God to increase our water supply while the Governor
 does his best to increase demand?

Is Growth Over? California's Continuing Water Crisis May Mean the End of
 the State as We Have Known It.
</a></h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
July 20, 2008 &nbsp;
Los Angeles Times</span>
<p>
Arnold Schwarzenegger's order certifying that California is in a drought
 and directing state agencies to think what to do about it is only the 
latest sign that a way of life built on available water is coming to a 
close. The continuing water crisis raises the question of whether we are
 approaching the limits of growth in California.</p>

<p>California's economy and population exploded, fueled in large part by
 abundant water supplies. Snowmelt which historically has filled the 
state's major reservoirs has been shrinking steadily. California's 
rights to Colorado River water have been scaled back. Court orders aimed
 at protecting endangered fish have slashed water deliveries from the 
San Joaquin-Sacramento River Delta. Reduced rainfall has made it 
difficult to replenish groundwater basins.</p>

<p>Now, the situation is that the water agencies are beginning to give 
the public a taste of what lies ahead.</p>

<p>The largest water agency in the region and the principal supplier to 
the cities announced a 30% reduction in deliveries to agricultural 
customers. The agency adopted a plan that could result in similar 
cutbacks to urban consumers and rate hikes of up to 20%. Such steps 
alone will probably not make enough of a difference to avert a 
water-supply crisis. There is a finite amount of water in Southern 
California, and it has not increased since 1990. Major sectors of the 
state's economy such as agriculture and real estate development will 
soon face unimagined restrictions.</p>

<p>Environmental groups contending that many water-use practices violate
 the state's constitutional mandate that water be put to beneficial use 
to the maximum possible extent and that waste or unreasonable use be 
prevented.They object to pumping water from the San Joaquin-Sacramento 
River Delta to irrigate cotton and alfalfa, as well as lawns. These 
environmentalists plan to petition to permanently reduce Delta pumping 
that would affect every aspect of water use.</p>

<p>State laws require water agencies to document sufficient long-term 
supplies to support large developments. The Eastern Municipal Water 
District, the largest water agency in Riverside County, recently delayed
 approval of a huge industrial development because it couldn't guarantee
 water supplies. The state Supreme Court overturned approval of a major 
new planned community in the Sacramento area because the project's 
environmental impact report did not adequately address long-term water 
supplies. </p>

<p>Don't expect new homes to be built along a new golf course or the 
shores of a man-made lake. The appliances in the new homes will be 
low-flow, and the pavement outside permeable to help replenish 
groundwater. The Legislature is considering a requirement that all urban
 water agencies reduce their consumption by 20% within 12 years.</p>

<p>Agriculture is also feeling the sting of dwindling water supplies. 
Agencies throughout the state are pressing farmers to cut their water 
consumption by not growing water-intensive crops, investing in more 
efficient irrigation systems and even taking land out of agricultural 
use altogether.</p>

<p>Yet it is unrealistic to expect that California's population will 
stop growing. 
The current shortage of water is largely the product of global warming. 
The easiest way to increase water supplies is conservation.</p>

<p>California is approaching the limits of growth. Those areas with 
limited local water supplies already are off-limits for development, and
 big users of water, such as agriculture, are cutting back.

US California: Ammonia From Sacramento Waste Could Hurt Delta Ecosystem.
</a></h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
June 01, 2008 &nbsp;
Sacramento Bee</span>
<p>
Sacramento's regional sewage treatment plant discharges treated 
wastewater from nearly 1.4 million people into the Sacramento River 
without removing ammonia.</p>

<p>Two recent studies show that ammonia disrupts the food chain in the 
Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta.</p>

<p>The discovery, if it holds up to further scientific review, 
illustrates how fixing the Delta will be a costly task. The Sacramento 
Regional County Sanitation District estimates it needs as much as $1 
billion to remove ammonia from the metro area's wastewater. It seems to 
interrupt a natural food production line that would otherwise yield 
abundant blooms of tiny aquatic animals to feed salmon, smelt and bass, 
but those species have been in steady decline.</p>

<p>The ammonia threat was illustrated when dozens of chinook salmon 
showed up dead in the San Joaquin River near Stockton's sewage outfall. 
Sacramento's effluent problem is slightly different, the threat is the 
enormous volume of ammonia-laced wastewater. The plant near Freeport 
each day releases about 146 million gallons of treated wastewater into 
the Sacramento River. The Sacramento River is traditionally considered 
the Delta's lifeblood, because it provides the vast majority of fresh 
water entering the estuary.</p>

<p>But Sacramento has been growing like gangbusters, and so the water's 
perhaps not quite clean as we thought.</p>

<p>The ammonia load in Sacramento's wastewater has more than doubled 
since 1985 due to rapid urbanization and the regional sewer agency is 
planning a major expansion that includes no ammonia controls.</p>

<p>Sewage officials estimate upgrading to filter out ammonia would cost 
$740 million. To remove excessive nitrates produced as a byproduct of 
that treatment would raise the cost to $1 billion.</p>

<p>District engineers estimate these steps would boost sewage rates in 
the region from $19.75 per month to $62.17.</p>

<p>Growth in Sacramento's ammonia output has coincided with a decline in
 diatoms, an important phytoplankton at the base of the food chain.</p>

<p>The volume of human wastewater may be starving Delta fish by shutting
 down food production.</p>

<p>Young fish eat small animals called zooplankton that  in turn, feed 
on diatoms and other phytoplankton.</p>

<p>Phytoplankton require nutrients and enough sunlight to bloom in 
sufficient numbers. Nitrates are the favored nutrient. Ammonia is 
another.</p>

<p>Phytoplankton can't feed on nitrates when there is too much ammonia 
in the water. A toxic type of algae, has begun to replace more 
nutritious phytoplankton. So ammonia may also encourage the rise of 
harmful foods.</p>

<p>New studies are under way to confirm whether Sacramento's sewage is 
the true cause.</p>

<p>"If it's part of the problem, the river just could never handle that 
amount and reduce it. Sacramento's regional sewage plant uses a 
so-called "secondary" treatment process that has become outdated. Most 
other urban areas have upgraded to "tertiary" systems that add rigorous 
filtration steps.</p>

<p>Sacramento has been able to avoid this expense so far, Snyder said, 
because its wastewater is quickly diluted to legally acceptable levels 
by the strong flow of the Sacramento River.</p>

<p>A Sacramento Superior Court judge ruled against the district on a 
number of points filed by many of the water agencies that divert 
drinking water from the Delta to serve more than 20 million people 
throughout California.</p>

<p>The court ruled that the Sacramento district "ignored a significant 
component of the environment" by failing to fully assess the additional 
nutrients pumped into the Delta in the region's wastewater.</p>

<p>The ammonia threat can be fixed if further research confirms it to be
 a danger.</p>

<p>But there is no fix for the predicted sea level rise that could 
overwhelm Delta levees, nor any practical way to remove foreign species 
invading the estuary.

U.S.: Opinion: Deepwater Horizon Debacle Pushes Alt Energy.
</h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
May 5, 2010 &nbsp;
Pure Energy Systems</span>
<p>
The destruction of the Deepwater Horizon rig, 50 miles south of 
Pascagoula Mississippi, in the US Gulf of Mexico is a profound event for
 Oil and particularly for US Oil production off shore. It is at least a 
billion dollar loss, not to mention the $100 Billion dollars previously 
invested in this well.</p>

<p>The well is 5.5 miles deep from the ocean floor in 1 mile deep water 
in a canyon area associated with the Mobile River. The equipment broken 
during the catastrophe lies on the ocean floor spilling at least 5,000 
barrels of very light weight crude oil a day, and likely to accelerate 
as the area around the well becomes more and more unstable.  </p>

<p>The oil slick covers an area of about 5,000 square miles and is 
growing rapidly. The damage to the tourism industry in Alabama and 
Florida may exceed $25 billion a year for several years.</p>

<p>Mobile Bay is a fishery and will suffer loss of large marine 
fisheries and wildlife. Ships cannot be run in the oil slicked waters. 
55% of USA international trade will be lost with the Mississippi River 
closed.</p>

<p>The loss of this rig alone could account lost production in the order
 of 5 to 10 million barrels per day over the next 6 years. Due to this 
disaster, the Obama Administration has just stopped all off shore 
drilling.</p>

<p>Continuing to solve energy needs with oil costs too much. Alternative
 Energy is cheap by comparison.</p>

<p>The Continental 750,000volt DC super conducting backbone would have 
cost us about $40 billion and that would produce the ability to produce 
with wind and solar power much more energy than this rig could ever hope
 to have supplied. </p>

<p>Solar Cells are coming on that may reach over 90% efficient, 
providing electrical generation at 1/5th of the cost of current 
technology. Magnetic powered devices also show promise.</p>

<p>The USA has already spent nearly $500 Billion into fusion research 
with no results while research into Alternative Energy was left 
unfunded.</p>

<p>Humanity must obtain its energy without destroying the earth. The 
consequences of failure are war and destruction on many levels.

The Imminent Crash of the Oil Supply.
</a></h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
April 6, 2010 &nbsp;
The Market Oracle</span>
<p>
<img src="mauvepg2.php_files/eia_oil_supply.html" alt="Graph: crash of 
oil supply" style="float: right;">This graph comes, not from any radical
 leftist organization, or from terrorists, but rather from the United 
States Department of Energy - and the United States military's Joint 
Forces Command concurs with the overall picture. It was prepared for a 
DOE meeting in 2009.</p>

<p>It implies that the supply of the world's most essential energy 
source is going off a cliff in a year and a half.  Production of all 
liquid fuels, including oil, will drop within 20 years to half what it 
is today.</p>

<p>This graph tells us:</p>

<p>1. Conventional oil will be almost all gone in 20 years.</p>

<p>2. Production of petroleum from existing conventional sources has 
been dropping at a rate slightly over 4% per year for at least a year 
and will continue to do so for the indefinite future. </p>

<p>3. We are past the peak of production, with 750 billion barrels of 
conventional oil left.</p>

<p>4. Total petroleum production from all presently known sources, 
conventional and unconventional, will remain "flat" for the next two 
years and then will start dropping, at first slowly but by 4% per year 
after 2015.</p>

<p>5. Demand will begin to outstrip supply in 2012, and will already be 
10 million barrels per day above supply in only five years. This is 
equivalent to half the United States' entire consumption. The world 
would have to find another Saudi Arabia and get it into full production 
in five years, an impossibility. See The Oil Drum, 
http://www.theoildrum.com/node/5154</p>

<p>6. The production from presently existing conventional sources will 
plummet by 63% in a 20-year period.</p>

<p>7. Meeting demand, assuming a conservative estimate of a 1% annual 
growth in demand, requires discovering, developing, and bringing to full
 production 60 mbpd of "unidentified projects" from 2012 to 2030, with 
approximately 25 mbpd needed by 2020.  Only 6.5mbpd of such projects, 
including the Canadian tar sands, has been deemed possible by the 
independent Oxford Institute of Energy Studies.  60 mbpd is equivalent 
to 3/4 of today's total production.  We have never in history done 
anything comparable to that. </p>

<p>The tar sands of Alberta, Canada seemed promising, but because a high
 percentage of the energy value of the tar sands has to be expended in 
their extraction, and, consequently, the likelihood of the tar sands 
making a significant contribution to the world's petroleum demand in the
 foreseeable future is low.</p>

<p>The curve is virtually identical to one produced by geologists Colin 
Campbell and Jean Laherrere and published in "The End of Cheap Oil," in 
Scientific American, March, 1998, twelve years ago. The warning signals 
have been been there for a long time, but the world turned a blind eye. 
The world was completely transformed by oil for the duration of the 
twentieth century, but if the graph is right, within 20 years it will be
 virtually gone but our dependence upon it will not. Colin Campbell 
said: "Discovery reached a peak in the 1960s - despite all the 
technology we hear so much about, and a worldwide search for the best 
prospects. It should surprise no one that the corresponding peak of 
production is now upon us."</p>

<p>We have virtually no time to plan for: 
.replacing cars in our lives;  
.the manufacture and installation millions of furnaces to replace home 
oil furnaces; 
.producing the infrastructure necessary to carry out that task; 
.retooling suburbia so it can function without gasoline; 
.the replacement of the largest military establishment in history, 
almost completely dependent upon oil; 
.the support of nine billion people without the "green revolution," a 
creation of the age of oil; 
.the replacement of oil as an essential fuel in electricity production; 
preservation of millions of miles of roads without asphalt; 
.the replacement of oil in its essential role in EVERY industry; 
.the replacement of oil in its exclusive role of transporting people, 
agricultural produce, manufactured goods: i.e. ships transporting US 
grain to other countries, airlines linking the world's major cities, 
ships transporting Chinese manufactured goods to the billions now 
dependent on them; 
.the survival of the billions of new people expected by 2050 in the 
aftermath of "peak everything".</p>

<p>And there will be no capital, because of failing banks and public and
 private debt, to address these issues.</p>

<p>Time is so short because, if we at any time use more oil than allowed
 by the graph, we will have even less later; because we are already 
committed to supporting 2.5 billion more people on what we have; because
 every day we continue upward in our oil consumption, even though we 
continue to have more people who need it and billions who deserve to 
rise from abject poverty, we are making the future supply shortage 
worse.</p>

<p>The United States Joint Forces Command reported the failure of the 
oil industry to invest in the refining capacity necessary to permit 
expanded production, and said "Even were a concerted effort begun today 
to repair that shortage, it would be ten years before production could 
catch up with expected demand."</p>

<p>The "Hubbert Peak" theory predicted the peak and subsequent demise of
 the US oil inudustry 15 years in advance and within 2 years of its 
occurance. The theory says that with normal production methods, a 
country reaches peak production in its oil fields when they are 50% 
depleted, with the production curve being bell-shaped.  The peak can be 
postponed with innovative extraction techniques, but this only causes 
subsequent more rapid decline of the deposits and total extraction if 
anything decreasing.   The world reached the midpoint of its reserves in
 the last decade, so the 2005 "peak" implied by the above graph is very 
close to what would be expected.</p>

<p>In 1956 Dr. Hubbert told us that the peak of world petroleum 
production would be approximately the year 2000; this apparently quite 
accurate prediction by Hubbert has largely been forgotten. </p>

<p>The rate of discovery of new conventional oil has been steadily 
dropping now for forty years despite ever-more searching with 
ever-more-sophisticated technology.  The lag time between discovery and 
bringing to full production of a field is 30-40 years, so even if 
another oil field of Saudi Arabia size were discovered, it would barely 
affect the graph.</p>

<p>The US Joint Forces Command tells us: "The discovery rate for new oil
 and gas fields over the last two decades (with the possible exception 
of Brazil) provides little reason for optimism that future efforts will 
find major new fields."</p>

<p>OPEC members have business reasons to exaggerate their reserves, and 
companies on the public stock market want to satisfy their stockholders 
of their long-term viability, and all oil producers want to make their 
customers confident that they can rely on oil for the long haul.  By 
concealing their future from homeowners, oil companies have made 
trillions for the real estate business and the banks at the expense of 
those who chose urban sprawl over dense "near-in" housing, and the 
companies themselves will make trillions in the near future selling to 
consumers trapped into oil addiction, who might have sought alternatives
 more vigorously had they known how close the crash was.</p>

<p>Matt Simmons, the banker who has spent his post-Harvard-Business 
School career advising oil companies has warned that "the failure of 
Saudi Arabia and other major oil producers to provide transparent 
production data has left the world in a lurch, unable to know whether it
 can maintain an adequate supply of oil in the face of burgeoning demand
 Such uncertainty has led to indecision about whether the world should 
invest the huge sums of money necessary to develop alternative 
transportation fuel sources."</p>

<p>Part of the problem is that the historically-reliable US Geological 
Survey (USGS) declared that world reserves of conventional oil were 
around three trillion barrels rather than two, providing the world with 
an extra thirty years' supply at present consumption rates.  Former USGS
  employees disputed this estimate as relying "heavily on guesses to 
calculate new oil discoveries," and on doubling the usual 30% recovery 
rate from reserves "with no technology in mind capable of doing that." 
This led the Department of Energy during the Bush Administration to 
forecast a "production peak somewhere between 2021 and the start of the 
next century, with 2037 the most likely date."</p>

<p>In 2006 skeptics - Cambridge Energy Research Associates (CERA) - 
published a "theory" in a non-peer-reviewed report, that "peak oil" was 
in its totality a false concept, and that the true behavior of an oil 
field or conglomeration thereof was a peak followed by an "undulating 
plateau" and then a gentle decline by around 2% per year. The theory 
relies on information undisclosed, but industry refuses to disclose.</p>

<p>The percentage-reduction goals set by the UN, the US Congress, the 
Obama Administration and the oil industry for global warming legislation
 miraculously, although arguably coincidentally, fit quite precisely the
 percentage reductions in oil consumption that will be physically forced
 upon us all if you believe the above graph: an 18% drop from 2005 by 
2020, and an 85% drop from 2005 by 2050. It is hard to see how the 
negotiators could have come up with such correspondence if they had not 
all  been aware of the impending crash of production and the expected 
decline rate.</p>

<p>It is hard to see how the industry and the Department of Energy could
 have failed to see this coming.  Their failure to warn the public, 
given the consequences, verges on the criminal.  Why did they not heed 
the warning of Matt Simmons, advisor on peak oil to the Bush 
administration, as to the importance of transparency.  But they did not,
 and here we are.</p>

<p>It is a time for communities to prepare for community energy 
independence, because only that way will be safe. This means relying on 
the sun and wind and water that have always been with us. It means 
cooperation with each other to get through seriously difficult times.  
It means finding alternatives to oil throughout our lives as quickly as 
possible - the oil that runs our cars, the oil that heats our houses, 
the oil that runs generators for our electricity, the oil from which 
chemical fertilizers and insecticides and plastics and polyester are 
made, the oil that brings countless manufactured goods to us from 
overseas, the oil on which farmers depend for irrigation pumps, for 
transporting produce to market, for working the soil to bring us food.  
If you believe the graph, it will almost all be gone in 20 years.</p>

support off-shore wind power.</p>

<p>25% of the US population lives in the nine Atlantic states from

could take one third of the US population off the fossil grid.</p>

<p>Off-shore windpower potential down all nine Atlantic states is 330 
gigawatts, almost twice the total amount used. </p>

<p>90% of residents living within a block or so of the ocean get out and
 enjoy beach activities, swimming, walking, crabbing and clamming and 
they put a higher priority on protecting the coastal environment (76%) 
than improving the economy (69%), lowering taxes (65%), improving 
education (64%), or controlling growth (56%)</p>

<p>The Department of the Interior is developing a Comprehensive Energy 
Plan on the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf. Hopefully they will take this

The Oil Intensity of Food
</a></h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
June 5, 2009 &nbsp;
</span>
<p>
Since 1981, the quantity of oil extracted has exceeded new discoveries 
by an ever-widening margin.</p>

<p>Discoveries of conventional oil total roughly 2 trillion barrels, of 
which 1 trillion have been extracted so far, with another trillion 
barrels to go. 
This is oil that's buried far offshore or deep underground; oil 
scattered in small, hard-to-find reservoirs; oil that must be obtained 
from unfriendly, 
politically dangerous, or hazardous places.</p>

<p>Peaking oil production has  consequences for world food security. 
Most tractors use gasoline or diesel fuel. Irrigation pumps use diesel 
fuel, natural gas, or coal- fired electricity. Fertilizer production is 
energy- intensive. Natural gas is used to synthesize the basic ammonia 
building block in nitrogen fertilizers. The mining, manufacture, and 
international transport of phosphates and potash all depend on oil.</p>

<p>In the US, the use of gasoline and diesel fuel in farming fell from a
 high of 7.7 billion gallons (29.1 billion liters) in 1973 to 4.2 
billion in 2005--a decline of 45%. The gallons of fuel used per ton of 
grain produced dropped from 33 in 1973 to 12 in 2005, an decrease of 
64%.</p>

<p>One reason was a shift to minimum- and no-till cultural practices on 
two fifths of U.S. cropland. But in many developing countries fuel use 
is rising as the shift from draft animals to tractors continues.</p>

<p>Fertilizer accounts for 20% of US farm energy use. As the world 
urbanizes, the demand for fertilizer climbs.</p>

<p>The international food trade can separate producer and consumer by 
thousands of miles. The US, exports some 80 million tons of grain per 
year that contain basic plant nutrients: nitrogen, phosphorus, and 
potassium. The export of these nutrients would slowly drain the 
fertility from U.S. cropland if the nutrients were not replaced.</p>

<p>Irrigation is requiring more energy worldwide as water tables fall. 
In the US, close to 19% of farm energy use is for pumping water. And in 
India where water tables are falling, over half of all electricity is 
used to pump water. Some trends, are making agriculture less 
oil-intensive, but rising fertilizer use, the spread of farm 
mechanization, and falling water tables are having the opposite effect.</p>

<p>Transport, processing, packaging, marketing, and kitchen preparation 
of food are responsible for four fifths of the energy. </p>

<p>The energy used to move goods from farmer to consumer is equal to two
 thirds of the energy used to produce the food. And 16% of food energy 
use is devoted to canning, freezing, and drying food--everything from 
frozen orange juice concentrate to canned peas.</p>

<p>What is new is the shipment of fresh fruits and vegetables by air. 
Few economic activities are more energy-intensive.</p>

<p>The distance that food travels has risen with cheap oil. In assessing
 the future of long-distance produce transport, one writer observed that
 the days of the 3,000-mile Caesar salad may be numbered.</p>

<p>Packaging accounts for 7% of food system energy use. It is not 
uncommon for the energy invested in packaging to exceed that in the food
 it contains. The U.S. farmer gets about 20% of the consumer food 
dollar, and for some products, the figure is much lower. </p>

<p>Much more energy is used to refrigerate and prepare food in the home 
than is used to produce it in the first place. </p>

<p>With higher energy prices and a limited supply of fossil fuels, the 
modern food system will not survive as it is now structured.

U.S.: Our Mountains Are Under Siege.
</h4>
<span class="smallfont">

Sierra Club</span>
<p>
Our mountains are our legacy to future generations. But big coal 
companies are blowing the tops off the mountains, to extract the coal 
and destroy Appalachia.</p>

<p>Mountaintop removal coal mining has devastated the land and buried 
more than 1,400 miles of Kentucky streams. A recent court decision could
 open up dozens of new mountaintop removal coal mines.</p>

<p>The court decision has cleared the way for almost 100 new permits to 
bury streams in Kentucky and West Virginia, which would flatten 98 
square miles and bury more than 200 miles of streams in coal mining 
waste.</p>

<p>Mountaintop removal is devastating one of the oldest mountain ranges 
in the world, home to a diversity of plants and animals. The mining 
waste and toxic debris pours down the mountainside, filling valleys, 
burying our streams and creating mile after mile of barren moonscape.</p>

<p>It only takes one year for a coal company to destroy a mountain that 
has existed for close to 300 million years. Contact the Obama 
Administration and urge them to put an end to mountaintop removal coal 
mining.

Environmentalists Concerned On Effects Of Huge TVA Coal Ash Spill.
</a></h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
December 25, 2008 &nbsp;
The Chattanoogan</span>
<p>
Environmentalists are expressing concern about the effects of a huge 
overflow of coal ash from a TVA facility near Harriman, Tn.</p>

<p>Concerns include any possible effect on the drinking water at 
Chattanooga.TVA officials have not yet responded to the situation. The 
Kingston spill is 40 times bigger than the Exxon Valdez spill. 
Approximately 525 million gallons of coal ash flowed into tributaries of
 the Tennessee River, the water supply for Chattanooga and millions of 
people living downstream in Alabama, Tennessee and Kentucky.</p>

<p>Coal contains huge amounts of heavy metals, and when coal is burned, 
the nasty chemicals stick around, in higher concentrations. Coal slurry 
is toxic.</p>

<p>There has been a campaign for many years against coal sludge 
impoundment in Sundial, W.Va., which sits 150 feet above the Marsh Fork 
Elementary School, and holds 2.8 billion gallons. This disaster clearly 
demonstrates coal is not clean. There is no clean way to burn coal.</p>

<p>The toxic sludge destroyed 12 homes and has already resulted in a 
fish kill. This catastrophe has released toxins directly into 
tributaries of the Tennessee River.

US California: PG&amp;E Plans Big Investment in Solar Power.
</a></h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
August 15, 2008 &nbsp;
San Francisco Chronicle</span>
<p>
PG&amp;E (Pacific Gas and Electric) will buy 550 megawatts from 
OptiSolar, who would install thin-film solar panels on 9.5 square miles 
of ranchland in San Luis Obispo County and buy an additional 250 
megawatts from SunPower Corp., that would use an additional 3.5 square 
miles of San Luis Obispo land.</p>

<p>The purchase could show that photovoltaic power can be affordably 
produced on a large, centralized scale and makes large-scale solar an 
increasingly large part of the energy in the West. California's 
utilities are under a state mandate to generate 20% of their energy from
 renewable sources.</p>

<p>PG&amp;E received just 11.4% of its energy from renewable sources in 
2007, while Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric 
got 15.7% and 5.2% of their power from renewables.</p>

<p>Together with the 800-megawatt deal, solar contracts would increase 
renewable energy to 24% of PG&amp;E's portfolio by 2013. Solar power 
until now has been too expensive for utilities, costing about 40 cents 
per kilowatt hour, compared with 10 cents for natural gas and 12 cents 
for wind power. The contracts would not affect electricity rates paid by
 consumers.</p>

<p>OptiSolar and SunPower said they are able to offer a lower rate than 
traditional photovoltaic projects for a variety of reasons. Some experts
 cautioned that there are hurdles to cross before those 800 megawatts of
 power become a reality.</p>

<p>The plants will need approval from state and local government. 
Environmentalists will complain because of the amount of land involved. 
PG&amp;E will have to develop transmission lines to move the power to 
its customers. And OptiSolar and SunPower will need to finance 
construction of all those solar cells.</p>

<p>PG&amp;E has said the deals are contingent on Congress reauthorizing 
tax credits for renewable energy that are due to expire at the end of 
this year.

U.S.: Warning to Gulf Volunteers: Almost Every Cleanup Worker From the 
1989 Exxon Valdez Disaster is Now Dead.

CNN</span>
<p>
CNN reported that the vast majority of those who worked to clean up the 
1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska are now dead, and that the life 
expectancy for those who worked to clean up the Exxon Valdez oil spill 
is only about 51 years. Considering the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico 
is many times worse than the Exxon Valdez disaster, who would want to be
 on a cleanup crew. What we have out in the Gulf of Mexico is a "toxic 
soup" of oil, methane, benzene, hydrogen sulfide, other toxic gases and 
very poisonous chemical dispersants such as Corexit 9500.</p>

<p>The true health toll of this oil spill is not going to be known for 
decades.</p>

<p>Already a large number of workers cleaning up the BP oil disaster in 
the Gulf of Mexico report that they are suffering from flu-like 
symptoms. Exposure to the oil disaster has resulted in 162 cases of 
illnesses reported to the Louisiana state health department.</p>

<p>400 people have sought medical care for upper or lower respiratory 
problems, headaches, nausea, and eye irritation after trips to Escambia 
County beach.</p>

<p>If the Exxon Valdez oil spill is any indication, a lot of people are

 who will clean it up?

U.S.: New Mexico Dairy Pollution Sparks 'Manure War'.
</a></h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
December 9, 2009 &nbsp;
NPR</span>
<p>
Across the country, big dairies are coming under increased criticism for
 polluting the air and the water.</p>

<p>More and more milk comes from confined animal feeding operations 
(CAFOs), where large herds live in feedlots.</p>

<p>The average cow produces six to seven gallons of milk and 18 gallons 
of manure daily. With New Mexico's 300,000 milk cows, the manure is 
enough to fill up nine Olympic-size pools each day.</p>

<p>But none of these factory farms have a sewage treatment plant. What 
happens is the muck is hosed off the concrete floor of a milking barn, 
and it flows into a plastic- or clay-lined lagoon where the liquid 
evaporates. Then waste from the feedlot is collected and used as 
fertilizer for grain crops.</p>

<p>However the New Mexico Environment Department reports that two-thirds
 of the state's 150 dairies are contaminating groundwater with excess 
nitrogen from cattle excrement. Either the lagoons are leaking, or 
manure is being applied too heavily on farmland.</p>

<p>Adding to the problem is the tendency of large dairies to cluster 
together. On one stretch of road between Interstate 10 between Las 
Cruces, N.M., and El Paso, Texas, more than 30,000 cows live on 11 
farms, which have been repeatedly cited for violating the Clean Water 
Act because manure-laced stormwater was washing into tributaries of the 
Rio Grande.</p>

<p>There is a big problem for the residents there: the odor, the flies, 
and  contaminated well water.</p>

<p>Commodity agriculture, including dairies, is toward fewer and larger 
farms, which concentrates more manure in smaller geographic areas. </p>

<p>A dairy industry spokesman suggests that critics suggests that "They 
may have a septic tank that's leaking. That is the No. 1 reason why 
domestic wells in New Mexico are contaminated." Dairymen "want to make 
sure that their families that live on these dairies can drink that 
water, can bathe in that water and their animals are healthy as well."</p>

<p>The dairy industry is big in New Mexico, a poor state with little 
private industry.

<div class="comment">Karen Gaia says: these farms are profitable because
 a) there is a large population of people drinking milk, b) farms are 
run in the most efficient manner, which means operating a CAFO. Ideally 
CAFOs are located in isolated areas, but the size of these are shrinking
 as population grows.</div>

Gulf of Mexico Dead Zone.
</a></h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
October 20, 2009 &nbsp;
IntroToEppFall09.blogspot.com</span>
<p>
As the population of the world grows, so does our demand for food and 
thus the need for large scale agriculture, which in turn demands 
fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides for crops and large confined 
animal facilities to raise livestock.</p>

<p>In the U.S., the runoff from farms along the Mississippi river of 
waste water and fertilizer, mainly nitrogen and phosphorus, pour 
billions of pounds of excess nutrients into the Gulf of Mexico, creating
 a dead zone, where waters rich in mineral and organic nutrients promote
 the growth of algae, reducing the dissolved oxygen content and causing 
the extinction of fish and other marine life starting from the mouth of 
the Mississippi River and spanning sometimes all the way to the Texas 
border. </p>

<p>The Dead Zone was first recorded in the early 1970's. It originally 
occurred every two to three years, but now occurs annually, and over the
 past five years has covered 6,000 square miles.</p>

<p>The Gulf of Mexico dead zone threatens valuable commercial and 
recreational Gulf fisheries that generate about $2.8 billion per year. 
Commercial fishermen are forced to fish elsewhere or stop altogether. 
Some species of HABs have been proven to cause negative health effects 
on humans. Advancements in science and management have been made, yet no
 real difference has been made to the size of the dead zones.

US Oregon: Emission Goals Prove Elusive; as Population Grows, Caps on 
Greenhouse Gases Look Hard to Reach.
</a></h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
September 17, 2009 &nbsp;
Portland Tribune</span>
<p>
In Tualatin Oregon, the nation's first highway solar project has 
operated since 2008, but it may not be enough to meet future demand, due
 to population growth.</p>

<p>While the state of Oregon and the city of Portland have goals to 
reduce emissions believed to cause global warming, Portland General 
Electric says it needs to increase greenhouse gas emissions from its 
power plants to meet customer demand for additional energy during the 
next 20 years.</p>

<p>Environmentalists complain that PGE and the council are not trying 
hard enough to fight global warming, but the projections are consistent 
with what governments and utilities have experienced as they�ve tried to
 reduce greenhouse gases.</p>

<p>Portland was supposed to reduce emissions 10% below 1990 levels by 
2010. Emissions have fallen approximately 17% per capita since 2001, but
 due to population growth, the net reduction is likely to be 1 to 3% 
below 1990 levels � and some of that will be the result of the recession
 that curtailed driving, construction and employment.</p>

<p>Japan ratified the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, promising to cut its 
emissions by 6% below 1990 levels. But Japan�s emissions are at a 16% 
above its reduction goals.</p>

<p>In its Draft Integrated Resource Plan, PGE predicted that population 
and job growth will increase electricity demand within its service 
district by 2.3% a year � or 20% by 2020. Some of the increases can be 
met by conservation, energy efficiency and new renewable energy 
resources, including wind and solar power.</p>

<p>To meet demand on peak days, PGE must increase its share of the power
 produced by the coal-burning plant in Boardman and build two new 
natural gas-powered plants.</p>

<p>The Sierra Club denounced the draft, but PGE must have reliable power
 sources to meet peak demands.</p>

<p>The population in Oregon, Washington, Idaho and Montana is predicted 
to increase around 1% a year, driving up energy demand.</p>

<p>The draft estimates that conservation measures can meet only 85% of 
future demand growth.</p>

<p>The 2007 Legislature approved emission reduction goals 10% below 1990
 levels by 2020 and 75% below 1990 levels by 2050. But the 2009 
Legislature did not approve a cap-and-trade policy to help meet those 
goals.</p>

<p>The Portland City Council and Multnomah County commissioners want to 
cut emissions in the county 40% below 1990 levels by 2030 and 80% below 
1990 levels by 2050. As currently written, it predicts that in the 
future, conservation and energy efficiency measures can more than 
overcome the effects of population growth.

U.S.: Mines to Get Freer Hand to Dump Waste; New Rule Eases Water 
Protections.
</a></h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
October 20, 2008 &nbsp;
Washington Post</span>
<p>
The Interior Department is poised to issue a rule that will make it 
easier for mining companies to dump their waste near rivers and streams.
 This overhauls a 1983 regulation protecting water quality and marks a 
step over how companies should dispose of the rubble created. The rule 
will take effect after a 30-day review. For 25 years, the government has
 prohibited mining operators from dumping debris within 100 feet of any 
stream if the material harms the water quality or reduces its flow.</p>

<p>Mining companies have frequently disregarded the law. The revised 
rule calls on companies to avoid the 100-foot stream buffer zone "or 
show why avoidance is not possible." </p>

<p>The agency said the change would have a "slightly positive" effect on
 the environment "because it requires coal mining operations to minimize
 certain impacts. But the implications of this ruling are devastating.</p>

<p>Mountaintop-removal mining is used widely in West Virginia and 
Kentucky, and provides access to low-sulfur coal seams but generates 
large amounts of waste. President Clinton pushed to restrict dumping of 
mining waste but left office before enacting changes. The Bush 
administration has been seeking to rewrite the law.</p>

<p>EPA administrator Johnson must certify that the environmental impact 
statement is adequate. Environmental groups will fight the regulation in
 court.

U.S.: How Ike Scarred the Terrain; the Hurricane Ravaged the Texas Gulf 
Coast Two Weeks Ago, but the Damage it Did to Wildlife and Waterways 
Could Last Years.
</a></h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
September 30, 2008 &nbsp;
Houston Chronicle</span>
<p>
Migratory birds might not find refuge for a while on the Boliver 
peninsular. Hurricane Ike stripped the  trees. Ike caused environmental 
damage to Southeast Texas, ripping through the barrier islands, washing 
debris into Galveston Bay and the Gulf, and imperiling animals, fish and
 plants by pouring saltwater into marshes.</p>

<p>The upper Texas coast is under stress because of development, rising 
seas and sinking land. This has led to the erosion of the shoreline, by 
as much as 10 feet each year. The dunes and marshes reduce the strength 
of wind and waves and without the buffer, storms can do more damage.</p>

<p>The recent development boom along the coast won't help because dams 
and levees are stealing much of the sediment that once replenished 
marshes and barrier beaches.</p>

<p>As a general rule, every mile or two of wetlands, or any other kind 
of land, will reduce a storm surge by a foot. The surge destroyed 
grasses for grazing cattle and other vegetation.</p>

<p>Up to 20 miles inland, post-Ike samples showed salt levels 25 parts 
per thousand in water that usually has no salinity. There is concern 
over the plight of a variety of birds that stop for a meal of fish along
 the upper Texas coast on their way south for the winter.</p>

<p>Among the rookeries on the Bolivar Peninsula, the Houston Audubon 
Society's sanctuaries are covered with debris from destroyed houses and 
boats.</p>

<p>Debris and untreated sewage in Galveston Bay and the bayous around 
Greater Houston are sucking the oxygen out of the water, leaving little 
or none for marine life.</p>

<p>The city of Houston estimated that as much as 5 million gallons, or 2
 percent, of the sewage processed daily flowed into the bayous because 
of Ike-related power outages. While state and federal authorities have 
reported 2,221 spills of oil and other hazardous materials from Houston 
to Lake Charles, La., none of them is considered major.

down the East Coast. The plan is fueling a fresh round of debate in 
places that could be potential destinations. At issue is the smell and 
the threat to the environment. New York transports more than 1,300 tons 
of garbage each day to Fox Township, Pa., 130 miles northeast of 
Pittsburgh. Living near the landfill isn't bad because it's hard to 
smell or see from the street. But the landfill's protective liners won't
 hold up forever and 50, years from now, they'll be saying, 'What were 
those guys thinking, allowing this to be built in this community?. New 
York's new disposal plan is being watched in Virginia, which imported 
7.8 million tons of garbage last year, up 67% from 1997. The issue has 
been contentious since laws to slow the importation of trash were struck
 down by the courts. Officials in the Portsmouth area are considering a 
port that could receive up to 2,500 tons of waste a day from New York 
with a fee for every ton brought in, generating $1 million per year, 
plus $7 million more if enough went to an existing incinerator. "We're 
rich," executive Keller said, noting the township has bought new police 
cars and fire trucks with trash tipping fees. "We have millions of 
dollars in the bank." The risks for these communities are few, said 
Mickey Flood, chief executive of IESI Corp., a Fort Worth company that 
owns landfills throughout the eastern part of the country. Standard 
landfills don't accept hazardous materials and waste is also transported
 in sealed containers that are designed to be leak-proof. All water that
 touches garbage is required to be treated for pollutants. Still, 
problems arise. In December 2003, two schools near a landfill in 
Pennsylvania temporarily shut down when an overwhelming stink made it 
impossible for students to concentrate. Investigators blamed decaying 
gypsum board and made adjustments to a system that extracts vapors and 
burns them off. "Transporting garbage so far away means that the people 
that generate it don't have to deal with it, and where is their 
incentive to create less of it?"

U.S.: Closed Military Bases Can Leave Behind Pollution Problems.
</h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
March 29, 2005 &nbsp;
Scripps Howard News Service</span>
<p>
Only a small fraction of the site of the army's Fort Ord in California 
has been developed because of scarce and contaminated freshwater; the 
presence of endangered species; fear that development would increase 
sprawl and traffic; and unexploded munitions. With the Defense 
Department poised to release a new round of base-closures, possibly the 
largest number ever, the lesson from Fort Ord is that they can harbor 
environmental hurdles. While they may have a grand vision of what this 
property can become, the reality is that decades of working with 
weaponry and toxic substances has left the Defense Department with 
tracts of land that are unfit for most kinds of human habitation without
 costly environmental cleanup. Unexploded ordnance contaminates an 
estimated 10 million acres. There is not great technology for finding 
unexploded ordnance, people have to dig and walk the land using metal 
detectors. The Defense Department has spent nearly $12 billion on 
environmental cleanup at bases closed during previous  closures. A third
 of the land at closed bases has yet to be converted to civilian control
 primarily because of contamination; there are still a lot of 
challenging environmental cleanup projects left. Some communities have 
had an easier time, and more than 10,000 people live and work in new 
communities on the former Lowry Air Force Base in Denver. In less 
desirable areas, finding replacements for the tax base generated by 
closed installations can be a struggle for local officials. In 
low-income neighborhoods bordering the former Kelly Air Force Base in 
San Antonio, nearly 300 purple crosses have been erected in front of 
homes where residents are afflicted with or have died of cancer. 
Residents want the Air Force to clean up a plume of toxic chemicals in 
the groundwater. Federal studies have found no link between pollution 
and local health problems but a recent study did not rule out the 
possibility.

The Blackstone River in Rhode Island has suffered 200 years of

What Drives U.S. Population Growth?.
</a></h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
December 23, 2002 &nbsp;
Patrick Burns</span>
<p>
Between 1990 and 2000, 33 million people were added to the U.S. 
population, 40% from immigration. 67% of future U.S. population growth 
will be due to immigrants and their progeny. Differential mortality and 
fertility rates between Canada and the U.S. can be attributed to the 
Canadian health care system as folks are more likely to seek treatment 
in that country than they are in the U.S. The Canadian government 
prevents drug company price-gouging, so more women in Canada are likely 
to be using the Pill which costs half as much as in the U.S. and is used
 much more often in that nation. The U.S. will add 140 million people by
 2050. The fertility rate in the U.S. was higher than that of 70 other 
countries, including China, Korea, Thailand, Iran, Cuba, Singapore, and 
Sri Lanka.<br>
 The population of illegal immigrants is larger than the population of 
many states. In 1980, the Select Commission on Immigration and Refugee 
Policy proposed a cap on immigrants of 425,000 per year. Some 
conservative senators thought the numbers were too high and opposed an 
amnesty for illegal immigrants. In 1986, an amnesty was passed without a
 cap on legal immigrants. Legal immigration is over twice the level 
called for in the above-cited amendment. Population growth makes other 
environmental problems harder to solve. 33 million more people requires 
over 12 million housing units, 15.8 million more passenger cars that 
will consume about 825 million barrels of oil a year, all of the 
recoverable oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in less 
than four years. Over 75 million acres of forest will be needed to 
supply 33 million people with paper and wood, an area larger than that 
protected under the forest conservation rule.

<h4>

Can We Save California's Water?.
</h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
February 23, 2008 &nbsp;
AlterNet</span>
<p>
An effort is under way to save The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, 
California's least-known environmental jewel, a unique ecological, 
economic and cultural resource. The Delta is also a source of drinking 
water for two-thirds of California's 37 million residents.</p>

<p>The Delta is in crisis. The levees providing flood protection and 
secure water supplies are crumbling. The complex system by which water 
is moved through the Delta is over-subscribed and under the jurisdiction
 of federal and state court judges. </p>

<p>Seismologists predict a one-in-three chance of a catastrophic 
earthquake in the next 50 years that would damage or destroy major 
portions of the levee system and revert the Delta to an inland salt sea.
 Federal experts warn that Sacramento is now the most flood-prone city 
in the nation, exceeding New Orleans. </p>

<p>There is agreement that the Delta is unsustainable and unacceptable. 
Political gridlock has prevented California's leaders from fashioning a 
solution, and those problems have mushroomed into a crisis as government
 leaders have failed to act. </p>

<p>Governor Schwarzenegger appointed a Delta Vision Task Force to 
develop an independent vision for the Delta. The seven-member group 
began its work last March, advised by expert scientists and a group of 
stakeholders reflecting every conceivable interest. The resulting Delta 
Vision, recommends state actions approved unanimously. but will not be 
universally popular. It speaks some harsh truths, notably, that each day
 brings California closer to a major disaster. Task Force members noted 
that "what the nation learned from New Orleans and Hurricane Katrina is 
the terrible price of waiting."</p>

<p>Protection of the Delta's ecosystem and a reliable water supply for 
California should be primary goals. Among recommendations sure to spark 
controversy: 
Repairing the Delta is likely to require reduced water diversions -- or 
changes in the pattern and timing of diversions;  New, coordinated water
 conveyance and storage facilities are needed. Conservation and water 
system efficiency are the cornerstones of better water management;  
Urbanization must be halted, and the landscape should be dominated by 
agricultural, environmental and recreational uses. The locally-dominated
 governing structure must be changed, in favor of a single authority.</p>

<p>The Task Force is embarking on fashioning a plan it has presented to 
California's political leaders. That promises to be equally daunting. 
But the future of the Delta, and those who depend on it, will require 
equally bold thinking and actions in 2008.

Australia: Ads Spark Sex Fury.
</h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
October 20, 2010 &nbsp;
Herald Sun (Australia)</span>
<p>
Clinical psychologist Alison Grundy, who works with sex abuse victims, 
said advertisers were reaching a dangerous new low by using sexual 
violence as a marketing tool, including Calvin Klein's jeans ad, which 
is said has connotations of gang rape.</p>

<p>"If we continue to subject future generations of young men to great 
barrages of aggressive, misogynist, over-sexualised and violent imagery 
in pornography, movies, computer games and advertising, we will continue
 to see the rates of sexual violence against women and children that 
continue unabated today. Or worse,' she said. </p>

<p>In a post on renowned women's advocate Melinda Tankard Reist's 
website, Ms Grundy said cases of gang rape of girls as young as 13 were 
increasingly being reported to professionals in NSW and that advertisers
 were blurring the line between rape and group sex and the Calvin Klein 
poster was "clearly intimating' the gang rape of a woman. </p>

<p>Menswear brand Roger David has also drawn fire for selling T-shirts 
with semi-naked, gagged women.

US Alabama: Population Growth Outstrips Fire Departments.
</h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
February 06, 2006 &nbsp;
</span>
<p>
Fire departments are growing to provide services in Shelby County, where
 the population has nearly doubled since 1990. Pelham and Helena will 
spend more than $1 million to pay salaries and buy gear for two new fire
 stations. Calera has added a third station, but didn't get a federal 
grant to pay the $500,000 to hire 10 to 13 firefighters. Almost 7,800 
new homes will have been built including 3,315 new single-family 
dwellings. Chief of the Shelby Fire Department, said fire departments 
are drained as the population  expands. But almost all others outside 
Alabama's largest cities fall short of national standards that say a 
fire department will be within 1.5 miles of a built-up area and that 90%
 of the time the team responding within four minutes include four 
trained firefighters.  Impact fees and developers can bring money for a 
station, but city revenues or outside grants, would have to pay for 
personnel and gear. The Chief of Columbiana's volunteer fire department 
said that we have 30 volunteers, and as long as we have no money, we'll 
stay that way. The North Shelby department has 26 full-time and 12 
part-time staffers, a number not within the national staffing standard. 
Fire departments try to turn to options that won't add a burdensome 
cost. Wider use of mutual-aid agreements allows other cities to respond 
to emergencies near jurisdictional lines.

India: No Honour in Honour Killings.

The United Nations Population Fund, UNFPA, says an estimated 5,000 
people are victims of honour killing across the globe, including about 
1000 every year in India. Now the National Award-winning filmmaker 
Priyadarshan and producer Kumar Mangat Pathak are making a film on the 
subject, titled Aakrosh. The film releases worldwide on October 1, 2010.</p>

<p>This action-thriller is is a wake-up call for the Indian audience. In
 addition, the Central Government is introducing a Bill in the 
Parliament to provide for punishment to the honor killers. Starring in 
the film are Ajay Devgn, Akshaye Khanna, Bipasha Basu, Amita Pathak, 
Reema Sen and Paresh Rawal in the lead. Ajay, who plays an officer on 
special deputation to a location where honour killing is prevalent, 
says, "I'm happy to be part of this film. From time to time Indian 
filmmakers have been tackling socially relevant and current topics. For 
an actor, it is challenging to be part of such a film because such films
 are often a mirror for social crimes."</p>

<p>There has been no prior Indian film on the subject of honour 
killings.</p>

<p>A visibly disturbed Ajay sums up the issue saying, "There is no 
honour in honour killings".

U.S.: We Talk Up Women's Rights but Won't Ratify Equality Amendment?.

<span class="smallfont"> 
November 15, 2005 &nbsp;
Herald-Tribune (US)</span>
<p>
72% of U.S. citizens believe the Equal Rights Amendment is a part of our
 Constitution; however, the required 38 states never ratified the ERA. 
The amendment was proposed in 1923, but it wasn't until 1943 that 
Congress provided "Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied 
or abridged by the United States or any state on account of sex. The 
Congress shall have the power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, 
the provisions of this article. This amendment shall take effect two 
years after the date of ratification." On March 22, 1972, the proposed 
amendment was sent to all states for ratification. By 1982, 35 states 
had ratified the amendment but 38 is the number needed and we are three 
states short. Last May 6, concurrent resolutions supporting ratification
 of the ERA died in both the Florida Senate and House of 
Representatives. Because both resolutions died in committee, neither 
made it to the floor. But all is not lost we must become engaged and 
call, fax, write or e-mail our representatives and senators, and let 
them know we support the ERA being a part of our Constitution.

Women's Rights Fading in U.S.?.
</h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
August 26, 2005 &nbsp;
Detroit Free Press</span>
<p>
In 1920, U.S. women won the right to vote but other rights are in peril.
 The right to birth control and abortion is under ceaseless attack by 
religious conservatives. Roe v. Wade has been chipped at by 
parental-notification and consent laws, 24-hour waiting periods and 
other requirements. Two-thirds of states deny abortion coverage to needy
 women. Abortion providers are found in only 13% of counties nationwide.
 Since 1993, antiabortion zealots have killed seven abortion physicians,
 clinic workers and volunteers as part of the campaign against abortion 
rights. Foes of abortion are targeting the right to contraception. 
Efforts to make emergency contraception available over-the-counter 
nationwide have stalled. A majority of states do not require insurance 
companies to cover contraception. As a senior legal adviser to President
 Ronald Reagan, Roberts once endorsed a controversial service for 
aborted fetuses as "an entirely appropriate means of calling attention 
to the abortion tragedy." The lack of women's status and value is clear 
from the Democratic capitulation on Roberts' nomination. Senators should
 be objecting to Roberts on the basis that his appointment would ensure 
only one female justice on a court of nine. The Canadian Supreme Court, 
has four women justices out of nine. Why should U.S. women, be so 
underrepresented on our nation's high court?

In the US, 1 out of every 1,000 people are HIV-positive. In the capital,
 it's closer to 1 in 20 - an estimate calculated using a formula based 
on national trends. If the District were a country, it would rank 11th 
in the world in between Mozambique (1 in 14) and Tanzania (1 in 23). Few
 statistics are available on the number of HIV cases in the District. 
The city's HIV/AIDS Administration (HAA) does report AIDS cases, but it 
has not yet published information about HIV infections and how they were
 transmitted. HAA ought to have at least three years' worth of HIV data.
 Why not release it? Part of the problem is staffing shortages.  New 
leadership should direct resources to existing clinics where same-day 
HIV tests should be offered; to public schools so youth can receive 
information on how to prevent the spread of the disease; and to 
treatment providers in need of assistance in navigating the complicated 
grant process. The District's failure to produce data as well as the 
mismanagement of programs put funding, and lives at risk.

Family Planning Losing, Anti-Abortion Gaining.
</h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
May 19, 2005 &nbsp;
San Antonio Express-News (US)</span>
<p>
Almost $5 million will be cut from health services and given to groups 
that counsel women against abortion in Texas. Another $20 million will 
be diverted from family planning programs. The shift was criticized as 
shortsighted by family planning groups that said the $100 million their 
programs receive every two years is enough to serve only 25 percent of 
eligible women. Lawmakers hate abortion but are creating an environment 
where it will happen. Romberg criticized shifting $5 million to crisis 
pregnancy centers, while family planning programs offer contraceptive 
services as well as diagnose diabetes, cancer and sexually transmitted 
diseases. Proponents of the funding shift said crisis pregnancy centers 
could provide services for women who don't want an abortion. Those 
centers offer counseling for women who want to carry their baby to term.
 The budget move came before the Senate approved a measure requiring 
pregnant teenagers to obtain their parents' written consent to have an 
abortion. On the family planning side, the loss of $2.5 million a year 
will mean 3%, will not be able to receive those services. Federally 
qualified health centers offer family planning services, but shifting 
$20 million from current providers to those centers will put existing 
clinics in danger of closing down or cutting back their services. The 
centers draw down a high federal match to serve patients in medically 
underserved areas.

Make Research on Black Infant Deaths a Top Priority; State and Federal 
Governments Must Cooperate to Find Causes and Remedies for High 
Mortality Rate.
</h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
December 21, 2004 &nbsp;
Detroit News</span>
<p>
State and federal officials need to expedite programs to reduce the 
infant mortality rate among black families which is higher than whites, 
and studies are underway to determine why. For every 1,000 black 
children born in suburban Wayne, Oakland and Macomb counties, 19 will 
not survive their first year. The comparable figure for whites is 5. The
 problem is a complex knot of social and economic factors. In Pontiac, a
 quarter of the population is poor, while black families in Southfield 
have higher incomes. But African-American infants die at high rates in 
both cities. A federal grant and 10-year contracts totaling more than 
$100 million, are supporting infant mortality studies, but a lot is 
already known, thanks to previous work. Stresses during pregnancy 
including being poor, contribute to the problem, compounded with the 
pregnancy being unintended. Of 1,600 women who gave birth in 1996, 44% 
were unintended. Black infants die at high rates in Southfield, even 
though black there have incomes better than the regional average. Other 
factors including cultural differences and matters of assimilation. New 
studies should determine the precise causes and develop effective 
solutions.

USA in a Fragile State of Health, Report Says Obesity, Infant Mortality 
Slow Progress Since 2000.
</h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
November 08, 2004 &nbsp;
USA Today</span>
<p>
After 15 years of improvements, progress in health in the US has 
stalled. Obesity and infant mortality are the primary problems. An 
analysis of indicators reveals that healthy strides are slowing.  Driven
 partly by smoking-reduction programs, the nation became 17% healthier 
since 1990, but since 2000, improvements leveled off, rising only 0.2% 
each year. The growth in obesity is up 97% since 1990 and threatens the 
nation's health. Nearly 23% of the population has a body mass index of 
30 or higher, which is 30 or more pounds over a healthy weight. But 
while the effect of excess weight is largely still to come, the infant 
mortality rate is a trauma being felt now. More than 75 infants die each
 day  and are a sad reminder that the nation is not as healthy. The USA 
ranks 29th in the world in infant mortality directly related to mothers 
having access to both prenatal and pediatric care. But other maternal 
factors include obesity, smoking, infection and stress. The healthiest 
states and their percentage above the norm: Minnesota, 25%; New 
Hampshire, 23.9%; Vermont, 22.8%; Hawaii, 17.7%; and Utah, 17.6%. The 
least healthy and their percentage below the norm: Arkansas, -12.1%; 
South Carolina, -12.9%; Tennessee, -13.1%; Mississippi, -20.2%; and 
Louisiana, -21.3%. With rising rates of obesity and higher infant 
mortality rates, three problems are slowing health progress. *Percentage
 of people without health insurance. * Declining high school graduation 
rates. * Increased child poverty.

Coming Soon: The Vanishing Work Force.
</h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
August 29, 2004 &nbsp;
Urban Institute</span>
<p>
Half the workers who maintain the grid at Duquesne electric utility will
 be eligible to retire by the end of the decade. Half the 6,500 nurses 
at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center will hit 55 in the next 
seven years. At Westinghouse, which maintains nuclear power generators, 
the average age of engineers is the late 40's. A declining and aging 
population places at risk the stability of the work force and 
opportunities for economic progress. Older workers may have to stay on 
longer than planned. Pittsburgh has surplus workers, with an 
unemployment rate that jumped to 5.7% from 4.2% three years ago. Their 
power industry has shed 40% of jobs in the last 10 years. Yet more than 
16% of Pittsburgh's population is over 65. By 2012, Pennsylvania could 
face a shortage of 125,000 workers. This is an example of a drama 
unfolding across the nation. Those from 16 to 54 will have grown by six 
million from 2002 to 2012 but the 55-and-over will have expanded by 18 
million. By 2030, 55 and older will be 37% of the adult population, 15% 
today. 13% more people will retire from 2003 to 2008 than in the 
previous five years. Some companies are scrambling to secure tomorrow's 
work force. Duquesne Light set up a program to train new line workers. 
The University of Pittsburgh is trying to recruit new nurses and retain 
veterans. The restaurant industry is lobbying for easier immigration. 
Many companies are outsourcing jobs. To deal with the aging of America's
 labor force, workers will probably have to work longer. Alan Greenspan 
suggested that Social Security and Medicare benefits be curtailed to 
keep workers on the job longer. The aging of the work force has more to 
do with a decline in the production of young people. The fertility rate 
dropped from 3.5 children per woman in the mid-1950's to about 2 in the 
1970's. Aging is not just an American issue. By the time America's 
median age reaches 40, half of all Italians will be over 52. The US has 
drawn new immigrants who accounted for 47% of the increase in the labor 
force from 1990 to 2000. Yet the poor countries are getting older, too -
 by 2050, Mexico's median age will rise to 42. The expansion of the 
labor force will be 0.6% a year over the first half of the 21st century,
 from 1.6% in the second half of the 20th. In 2000, there were five 
people aged 20 to 64 for each person 65 or older. By 2030, the ratio 
will be less than 3 to 1. An economist at the University of Pennsylvania
 contends that unemployment leaves a big pool of workers and the 
abundance of baby-boomer labor wasn't so great for workers. Hourly 
earnings in fell by more than 15% from the early 1970's to the 
mid-1990's. If labor markets tighten, wages will rise and productivity 
accelerate, sustaining economic growth. Higher wages may draw older 
people into the job market. A 1998 study found that the rise in the 
dependency ratio could shrink US living standards by 10% by 2050. Our 
older people are staying on longer because they can't afford to retire. 
Over the past 50 years, corporate and federal policies have encouraged 
workers to retire as early as possible. Pension plans had favored early 
retirement. In 1950, 87% of men 55 to 64 and 46% over 65 were working. 
By 2000, this had dropped, to 67% and 17%. Employers could make it 
easier for older workers to stay, through flexible schedules and phased 
retirement. The government should offer Medicare as primary insurance to
 the elderly employed and readjust rules to allow employers to offer 
older workers sliding scales of benefits for part-time or occasional 
work. Rising medical premiums are rough on employers, but make it harder
 for people to leave before Medicare kicks in at 65. According to the 
2004 Retirement Confidence Survey,  barely 36% of workers are confident 
that they will have enough money to take care of basic expenses during 
retirement and those who expect to retire before 65 has dropped to 37% 
from 495 a decade ago. We are living longer but people haven't saved 
enough to afford the lifestyle we want, so are staying longer in the 
work force.

Administration Backs Off Clean Water Act.

December 17, 2003 &nbsp;
Los Angeles Times</span>
<p>
EPA announced that the administration would not revise the 1972 Clean 
Water Act since many urged the administration to abandon it. The 
construction industry warned it would have a negative effect on 
builders. The EPA had announced they were proposing a rule that would 
redefine which streams, lakes and wetlands would be protected after a 
Supreme Court ruling limiting federal jurisdiction over isolated, 
nonnavigable, intrastate waterways and wetlands that were protected 
because migratory birds use them. The EPA received 133,000 comments most
 urging them not to go forward. State and federal officials estimated 
that up to 20 million acres of wetlands could have lost protection. In 
the majority of the cases, the courts have taken a narrow view of the 
ruling, finding that even some drainage ditches should be granted 
protection. Construction industry officials said that without a new rule
 the Corps would inconsistently apply the Supreme Court ruling. But the 
Supreme Court may have more to say as it has been asked to hear four 
cases on the subject.

Reuters</span>
<p>
The average age at which a woman has her first child rose from 21.4 in 
1970 to 25.1 in 2002. The teen birth rate declined 30% since 1992 to 43 
births per 1,000 females. The birth rate among black teens decreased 
from 114.8 births per 1,000 females in 1991 to 66.6 per 1,000 in 2002, a
 drop of more than 40%. The drop in teen pregnancy is linked to public 
health awareness campaigns. There were mild concerns about the rise in 
the number of women giving birth to their first child in their 30s and 
40s; being the highest in more than 30 years. Women who give birth after
 age 35 have a higher risk of birth defects and other complications.

Government Admits Role in Klamath Fish Die-off.
</a></h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
November 19, 2003 &nbsp;
Oregonian, The</span>
<p>
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service admits that low river levels caused 
migrating salmon to succumb to disease in warm, stagnant water with 
depleted flows from the Upper Klamath Basin when the administration gave
 farmers a full allocation of water. This underscores the competing 
water demands of wildlife and agriculture. A biologist said it was the 
combination of a large salmon run, warm weather and low rainfall that 
turned deadly. Bush officials never doubted that more water might have 
aided fish. More water from the Trinity River in Northern California 
would also feed into the Klamath River if it were not diverted to 
California's Central Valley. The administration won permission to direct
 more water down the Trinity into the Klamath if needed to avert another
 die-off. Protections for fish in Upper Klamath Lake and River left 
little water for farms during the drought of 2001. Flows fell to low 
levels in September 2002, and were 41% below average since 1960. Flows 
from the Trinity River into the Klamath were near their historical norm.
 Warm water temperatures may have put the fish under extra stress 
together with slow-moving water created conditions for disease. Fish and
 Wildlife estimated the fish death toll at 34,056, 98% of which were 
salmon, of which 98% percent were chinook, and 1% coho.

Percentage of Childless U.S. Women Up Since 1976, Census Bureau Report

</a></h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
October 24, 2003 &nbsp;
San Jose Mercury News</span>
<p>
The percentage of U.S. women of childbearing age who have not had 
children has increased since 1976. 44% of women of 15 to 44 were 
childless in 2002. 18% of women 40 to 44 were childless, compared with 
10% in 1976. Women 40 to 44 had 1.9 children in 2002, less than the 1976
 average of 3.1. 71% of childless U.S. women 15 to 44 were in the labor 
force in 2002. 54.6% of women with children under age one were in the 
work force in 2002, down from 58.7% in 1998. Delaying childbearing can 
sometimes result in no childbearing. The decline may also be linked to 
increased access to contraceptives. Women in the work force are delaying
 childbearing, and some are no longer able to get pregnant when they 
decide to have children. 60% of all births in the year ending June 2002 
were to non-Hispanic white women, 20% to Hispanic women, 15% to black 
women and 5% to Asian or Pacific Islander women. * 33% of all births in 
2002 were to unmarried women, a percentage that is constant since 1998. 
8% of all births were to women in "cohabiting unions." * 89% of births 
to teenagers were to unmarried teens, while 12% of women between ages 30
 and 44 giving birth in 2002 were unmarried.

Proposal Plots to Drain Florida's Water Wealth.
</h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
August 24, 2003 &nbsp;
St. Petersburg Times</span>
<p>
A proposal to create a statewide water commission with the power to 
drain water from rural counties and pipe it to metropolitan areas has 
drawn thumbs-down reactions from rural counties.  The proposal came via a
 group of business leaders that advises the governor who approves their 
membership and the issues it studies. They named a Clearwater developer 
to head a task force to look at Florida's future water needs that 
includes developers, agricultural interests and newspaper publishers. 
They recommend Gov. Bush to make water as important as protecting the 
environment. The proposed commission, including seven members appointed 
by the governor, would identify water-rich areas and consider a 
statewide distribution system. Water belongs to the public in Florida 
and changing that could provide big profits for the private sector. Now,
 five water management districts regulate how much water is pumped and 
who pumps it. Utilities can charge to deliver it. The commission would 
oversee the water districts, settle distribution disputes and plan to 
meet future needs. The task force recommends encouraging private water 
development on state-owned land that could find favor with a governor 
determined to give private companies every opportunity to profit. 
Draining rural areas to support growth elsewhere is a no-win proposition
 for everyone but developers.

Montana's teen pregnancy rate dropped 32.6% from 1981 to 2000, twice the

 However, the declining rates are still among the highest in the

US Wisconsin: Sturgeon Warning.

<p>
There are more sturgeon in and around Lake Winnebago than anywhere on 
the planet. In the 1970s and '80s management and lake cleanup set the 
stage for a rebound of the Winnebago sturgeon. The success attracted 
potential poachers, and wardens couldn't adequately protect the species.
 In 1987, the state asked for volunteers, and the Sturgeon Guard was 
born. Volunteer guards are fed a meal at Fish Camp, issued a cell phone,
 and sent to spawning hot spots. During spawning season, the fish are 
oblivious to anything else. Lake Winnebago sturgeon spawn upstream in 
the Wolf and Embarass rivers, to locate rocky shoals suitable for 
mating. The males swim in small packs, the females arrive and release 
eggs; the males release sperm. Most eggs are scarfed up by turtles and 
fish.

US Colorado: High and Dry.
</a></h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
April 29, 2003 &nbsp;
Grist Magazine</span>
<p>
Colorado is suffering a three-year drought. The average snowpack was 
half of normal, and streams the lowest in 100 years. The majority of the
 water comes from the Western Slope of the Rockies  and the drought is 
responsible for development constraints, wildfires, declining tourism, 
and some of the state's $900 million deficit. Municiple officials say 
there is no way around building new reservoirs and diversion pipelines. 
Environmentalists claim this could cost billions and wreak havoc on 
rivers and forests; they claim the needs can met through reduced 
consumption. The state government believes that the long-term issue is 
storage, because they can't store all the water they are entitled to. 
Enough to supply 2 million families flow out of the state, much of the 
lost water leaves through the Colorado River and is used by Arizona and 
California. State officials and developers are backing the Colorado 
Aqueduct Return Project, that entails building a 200-mile long pipeline 
to pump Colorado River water to the Front Range to be recycled. The 
river would then carry a stream of used water to farms and towns on the 
Western Slope. The pipeline would cost at least $5 billion. To West 
Slope communities and environmentalists, the project is absurd. The 
legislature approved $500,000 for a study, but the project could be 
derailed due to its price and environmental impact. A state bond issue 
exists for water projects and cities can purchase existing rights from 
farmers for less money than any new development. The lack of provisions 
such as requiring that conservation measures be considered before any 
new development may encourage towns to build dams and reservoirs. 
Colorado's environmental organizations promote "Smart Storage" and 
"Smart Supply" instead of new development and say conservation goals can
 meet Front Range water needs over the next 40 years. But the 
legislature balked at conservation. Agriculture accounts for 85% of 
water use and bills to enable the sharing of agricultural water with 
thirsty cities are in the state legislature.

US New Jersey: Sprawl: Water Regulation to Face Legal Battle.
</h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
April 27, 2003 &nbsp;
Star-Ledger</span>
<p>
Gov. James E. McGreevey announced a curb on development around 15 bodies
 of water, including nine reservoirs, but it will have to survive a 
court of law. Builders are challenging. Both sides agree that the stakes
 of the expected court battle are enormous. If builders lose, McGreevey 
could give teeth to the "smart-growth" map he unveiled in January. The 
new rule designated nine reservoirs and six streams as Category One 
(C1)water bodies and nothing can be discharged into them that worsens 
the water quality. This would make subdivisions, more difficult to 
build. The state will propose C1 status for 40 more bodies of water. If 
C1 becomes widespread it can wipe out all available land for 
development. Builders have been successful in court battles at thwarting
 the water quality regulations, including strict septic tank and 
wetlands rules. Land-use planning has been the province of the 
Department of Community Affairs which expects a challenge from builders.
 Builders could also challenge each designation.  Barring some 
procedural mistake by the DEP, builders would have to show that the rule
 is "arbitrary and capricious" to have it overturned.

In India, the amount of software and back-office services performed for 
companies outside India is expected to reach $54 billion by 2008. The 
Indian market for the same services is expected to reach just $15 
billion. The software and technology services are a high

Denver Limits Lawn Watering for 1.2 Million Customers .

Associated Press</span>
<p>
Denver has restricted outdoor watering. The rules allow residents to 
water two hours twice a week. The Water Board has imposed surcharges on 
residents who use excess water. Commercial users and city parks must 
reduce water consumption to 70% of 2001 usage. Golf courses must cut 
consumption in half. Denver's reservoirs were at 44% capacity Wednesday.
 Levels could increase to 79% percent by July 1 with runoff from the 
snowpack, if spring precipitation is average. The estimate is 66% if 
this spring is dry.

US Michigan: Growth:  400,000 New Homes Needed by 2030.
</h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
March 04, 2003 &nbsp;
PRNewswire</span>
<p>
The population of southeast Michigan will reach 5.5 million by 2030, a 
growth rate of 1/2% per year, says the Southeast Michigan Council of 
Government (SEMCOG). This will demand 400,000 additional residences in 
the seven county area in the next 30 years. This will strain the 
resources of available housing. Buildable land is 38% of total acreage. 
The demand is getting attention in Lansing. There is too much 
infrastructure for housing of one unit or fewer per acre, water, sewer 
and electricity costs increase with large lot zoning. Remodeling or 
rebuilding of older homes will be necessary to provide accessibility as 
the population ages. A regional government would alleviate difficulties 
in dealing with different set of requirements in different areas. The 
current population and the local government must plan for growth.

Wetlands Need Plenty of Help, Cash.

<span class="smallfont"> 
March 13, 2003 &nbsp;
The Advocate Online (Baton Rouge Louisiana)</span>
<p>
Louisiana's coastline can only be restored to a maintainable level with 
$14 billion in federal aid. Wetlands devastation in the state can be 
traced back to decisions on control of the flooding of the Mississippi 
River and to aid oil and gas projects in the region said Karen 
Gautreaux, chair of the state's wetlands  restoration panel and 
executive assistant to the Governor. The state benefited from those 
decisions, but cannot deal with the problems. The administration and 
Congress have to be made aware that Louisiana's coastal losses affect 
defense and the economy for the country. Backers hope to see federal 
funding get through Congress in 2004 with a commitment to spend that 
much over time.

Snow salt, debris could harm rivers. Stone flies just beginning to

 melt snow along the state�s roadways. These organisms are part of the 
food chain in the streams. They break down leaves, provide organic

little space to pile snow, Philadelphia decided to dump it into the

US New York: Highlands Area Needs More Protection.
</h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
February 20, 2003 &nbsp;
New York Times*</span>
<p>
The York-New Jersey Highlands is worthy of protection from 
overdevelopment, but less than half is protected. Its population 
increased by 11% from 1990 to 2000, and 100,000 acres face development. 
The government has not said how much should be taken out of private 
hands for preservation, and who should pay for it. The Highlands 
Coalition proposed saving 180,000 acres in New York and New Jersey at a 
cost of $750 million. At the same time, Congress provided only $7 
million to save 25,000 acres. Several Congressional representatives made
 it a requirement in budget appropriations that the secretaries of 
agriculture and the interior come up with recommendations about how to 
preserve the highlands. Those recommendations may be made public soon. 
There is an awareness of too much development, and there is now more 
talk in many quarters, about how to save the Highlands.

China: The One-Child Fallacy.
</h4>
<span class="smallfont"> 
November 2, 2010 &nbsp;
Slate Magazine (U.S.)</span>
<p>
China had up 1.29 billion people in 2000, and demographers estimate the 
current population at
more than 1.33 billion. The one-child policy has been in place for 30 
years. Why hasn't the population declined? </p>

<p>The architects behind China's one-child policy never expected to cut 
the population immediately, because the millions of young children born 
before implementation are now in their reproductive years and having 
kids faster than the smaller elderly population is dying off. This 
phenomenon, known as population momentum, creates a 50-60 year gap 
between a drop in the fertility rate and an actual population decline. 
In addition, the one-child policy isn't really a uniform, nationwide 
prohibition on multiple children. </p>

<p>Within three years of the program's initiation, massive protests in 
rural areas forced officials to revise the policy, and today the number 
of children allowed for each parent depends on a variety of factors. 
Lots of couples have two or even three children by exploiting legal 
loopholes, paying fines, or simply lying to the government. </p>

<p>The one-child policy doesn't apply to most ethnic minorities, such as
 the Uighurs, Tibetans, and Kazakhs. In some provinces, if either one or
 both parents have no siblings, it's possible to have two kids. Rural 
areas typically permit a second child, especially if the first is a 
girl. City people are the most likely to get caught up in the one-child 
policy, though even some cities are experimenting with allowing two 
children. If they really want a big family, wealthy Beijing denizens 
simply pay a fine to register their second or third child. (The one- 
time penalty can be up to six times the family's annual income.) Less 
affluent parents hide their extra kids, either by sending them away to 
school or passing them off as nieces and nephews. </p>

<p>China's population was 981,235,000 in 1980, the year that Deng 
Xiaopeng launched his family planning campaign. The country has added an
 average of 12 million people per year since then, the equivalent of 
birthing the entire population of Greece or Belgium annually. Still, the
 one-child policy seems to have slowed expansion.</p>

<p>China's annual growth rate of 1.06% is one-third less than that of 
the world's population over the same period. While a few have argued 
that the fertility rate would have slowed on its own, the Chinese 
government claims the policy has prevented 400 million births, more than
 the population of the United States and Canada combined. Those missing 
Chinese people would today represent more than five percent of the 
world's population-and that's not counting the children they would
have had. </p>

<p>The one-child policy has had demographic impacts beyond 
population-size control. China now has 32 million more boys than girls 
under age 20, due to the illegal but widespread practice of sex- 
selective abortion. Few parents abort a girl the first time around, 
since they will be allowed another chance at a boy. But among 
second-born children in rural areas, there are 160 boys born for every 
100 girls.</p>

<p>The imbalance has accelerated steadily since ultrasound became widely
 available in the mid-1980s. In the near future, the scarcity of women 
may have a more profound impact on population growth than any government
 fine.
