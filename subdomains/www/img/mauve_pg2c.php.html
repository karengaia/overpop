												<h1><a href="#">Strange but True: How Soap Operas Might Save
 Us From Overpopulation. </a>  	</h1>   <h2><span class="date">August 
2010  </span>

													<span class="source"> AlterNet</span>
												</h2><p>
											Daniela Perdomo interviews Bill Ryerson of Population Media 
Center (PMC).</p><p>

											Human capacity was exceeded in the 1980s, bringing the planet
 into crisis. Global warming, food and water crises, even international 
conflict, can be traced to overpopulation. Natural resources are being 
consumed at a rate much higher than they can be replenished. Now at over
 6.8 billion people in the world, we're expected to number 9 billion by 
2050.</p><p>

											Bill Ryerson is using media to change behaviors that 
contribute to global overpopulation by using melodramatic soap operas on
 radio and television throughout the developing world (and soon, the 
U.S.) to teach listeners and viewers important lessons about family 
planning, reproductive health, HIV/AIDS and environmental preservation, 
and women's and children's rights.
</p><p>

											Africa has the least media coverage, particularly with 
television. In Ethiopia over half have radios and listen to them on a 
regular basis. So it's a majority of the world's population that has 
access to broadcasting. Latin America and in Asia, television reaches 
almost everybody. 90% of the Vietnam population watches TV. In Pakistan 
maybe two-thirds of the population watches TV on a regular basis.</p><p>

											Population Media Center uses the Sabido method, which used 
the Latin American version of soap operas, called telenovelas, or 
television novels. These are quite different from American soap operas 
because they are much shorter. They are the dominant prime-time format 
in Latin America and they are popular and engrossing. They are also 
melodramatic -- depicting the battle of good versus evil.
</p><p>
											Miguel Sabido was a vice president of Mexico's largest 
commercial network, Televisa. He began looking at ways in which he could
 use the telenovela to provide audiences with information that would 
improve their lives. Using research and theory from psychologists, the 
creation of serialized melodramas that has proven over and over again to
 be highly influential in changing social norms on all kinds of issues.</p><p>

											Stanford psychologist Alfred Bandura is the world's authority
 on role modeling and how role models influence behavior and what makes a
 parent or a peer or a celebrity influence the people who are observing 
them. Using role models, the telenovela teaches self-efficacy, the 
confidence in the ability to accomplish some task.
</p><p>
											Where girls are denied education and are married off at 
puberty to older men in polygamous relationships and are not given the 
right to determine how many children to have and so on, changing the 
attitudes and behavior of the men as well as the women can be done 
through this strategy.
</p><p>

											Characters are created who start out in the middle of the 
road and sort through the conflicting advice they get from the positive 
and the negative characters and figure out who is right, and they evolve
 into positive role models for the audience. The negative characters 
always suffer the consequences of their behavior.
</p><p>
											The Sabido method is now in 24 countries around the world. In
 Brazil, a program called "Páginas da Vida," "Pages of Life,"contained a
 teenage pregnancy and parenthood storyline. This program influenced 
thirty-six% of the women clients of the family planning clinics to come 
because of that program. These women did not want to fall into the trap 
and the poverty and all the health problems that this teenage mother had
 fallen into. So they learned from that and they went to family 
planning. As a result of this program here was a 153% increase in condom
 distribution.
</p><p>
											In Tanzania a radio serial depicted an alcoholic truck driver
 with a girlfriend at every truck stop and a subservient wife waiting at
 home. His wife figured him out during the serial and told him she had 
heard about the AIDS epidemic and said that when he was home he was 
going to have to use condoms. She went on to become an entrepreneur and 
founded her own business, and she became a role model for female 
empowerment.</p><p>

											The truck driver became sick. 58% of the adult population 
heard this program, with more men in the audience than women, and they 
found out the truck driver had made a fatal mistake. Originally the men 
identified with the truck driver because he was having a good time, but 
then he started dying from AIDS. 82% of the audience in a survey after 
the two years said they had changed their behavior to avoid HIV 
infection. Most of them reduced the number of sexual partners. The 
second most common change was condom use.
</p><p>
											Ryerson said: "This is the most cost-effective approach that I
 have found anywhere in the world." In the Tanzania project, the cost 
per person who adopted family planning was 32 cents. The cost per person
 to change behavior to avoid HIV infection was 8 cents. When you can 
save lives at 8 cents a person, it is worth doing something.
</p><p>
											In Sudan, PMC developed a program where the major emphasis 
was on female genital mutilation. Before the program, 28% of the adult 
population thought FGM was a bad idea. After the broadcast, 65% of the 
population thought the practice should be abandoned.

</p><p>
											The Global Footprint Network have determined is our 
ecological footprint is 40% over what is sustainable. We are taking 
resources out of the bank and not replacing them. Water is one of the 
key resources: India, China and the United States are the top 
grain-producing countries, all three using underground fresh water 
aquifers for irrigation, as well as using river water for irrigation.</p><p>

											India, for example, is pumping out the water at twice the 
rate of replacement by rain water, and the water table is sinking by 10 
feet a year. Large areas of farmland in India are turning into desert. 
With the melting of the glaciers in the Himalayas, the regular flow of 
the rivers in India and China are also threatened.
</p><p>
											Cheap oil is a key element in fertilizers and pesticides and 
in planting, harvesting, transportation to market, refrigeration, 
packaging, distribution to supermarkets and taking it home and serving 
it, but oil reached an all-time peak two years ago. The price of grain 
and of both rice and wheat tripled and quadrupled on the world market, 
and there were food riots all over the developing world. When production
 of oil goes into decline in the face of expanding demand, the price of 
oil is going to go way up. The billion people living on a dollar or less
 a day may not be able to buy enough food to survive.
</p><p>
											We have gotten all the easy oil there is to get. Now we are 
drilling 5,000 feet below the surface of the ocean, high-risk operations
 trying to get the last bits of oil. The increase from one billion to 
almost seven billion people on the planet has occurred since the 
discovery of oil.
</p><p>
											Terrorism is partly a population-related issue. In 
high-population growth countries people are spending all of their money 
on food, housing and clothing. They have nothing left over to save. That
 means there is no capital formation. That means businesses can't 
expand. Therefore, there is no growth in employment. So you have a rapid
 growth in the number of people trying to enter the labor force and no 
jobs.</p><p>

											In urban centers like Karachi and Islamabad hundreds and 
thousands of unemployed men walking around angry and very concerned as 
to how they are going to survive.They are great prospects for recruiting
 into terrorism because they have nothing to lose.</p><p>

											PMC is planning a project available online to serve the 
Hispanic population in the U.S. to address the issues of teenage 
pregnancy prevention and obesity prevention among Latino populations.</p>

																						Daniela Perdomo interviews Bill Ryerson of 
Population Media Center (PMC).</p><p>

																						Human capacity was exceeded in the 1980s, bringing
 the planet into crisis. Global warming, food and water crises, even 
international conflict, can be traced to overpopulation. Natural 
resources are being consumed at a rate much higher than they can be 
replenished. Now at over 6.8 billion people in the world, we're expected
 to number 9 billion by 2050.</p><p>

																						Bill Ryerson is using media to change behaviors 
that contribute to global overpopulation by using melodramatic soap 
operas on radio and television throughout the developing world (and 
soon, the U.S.) to teach listeners and viewers important lessons about 
family planning, reproductive health, HIV/AIDS and environmental 
preservation, and women's and children's rights.
											</p><p>
																						Africa has the least media coverage, particularly 
with television. In Ethiopia over half have radios and listen to them on
 a regular basis. So it's a majority of the world's population that has 
access to broadcasting. Latin America and in Asia, television reaches 
almost everybody. 90% of the Vietnam population watches TV. In Pakistan 
maybe two-thirds of the population watches TV on a regular basis.</p><p>

																						Population Media Center uses the Sabido method, 
which used the Latin American version of soap operas, called 
telenovelas, or television novels. These are quite different from 
American soap operas because they are much shorter. They are the 
dominant prime-time format in Latin America and they are popular and 
engrossing. They are also melodramatic -- depicting the battle of good 
versus evil.
											</p><p>
																						Miguel Sabido was a vice president of Mexico's 
largest commercial network, Televisa. He began looking at ways in which 
he could use the telenovela to provide audiences with information that 
would improve their lives. Using research and theory from psychologists,
 the creation of serialized melodramas that has proven over and over 
again to be highly influential in changing social norms on all kinds of 
issues.</p><p>

																						Stanford psychologist Alfred Bandura is the 
world's authority on role modeling and how role models influence 
behavior and what makes a parent or a peer or a celebrity influence the 
people who are observing them. Using role models, the telenovela teaches
 self-efficacy, the confidence in the ability to accomplish some task.
											</p><p>

																						Where girls are denied education and are married 
off at puberty to older men in polygamous relationships and are not 
given the right to determine how many children to have and so on, 
changing the attitudes and behavior of the men as well as the women can 
be done through this strategy.
											</p><p>
																						Characters are created who start out in the middle
 of the road and sort through the conflicting advice they get from the 
positive and the negative characters and figure out who is right, and 
they evolve into positive role models for the audience. The negative 
characters always suffer the consequences of their behavior.
											</p><p>
																						The Sabido method is now in 24 countries around 
the world. In Brazil, a program called "Páginas da Vida," "Pages of 
Life,"contained a teenage pregnancy and parenthood storyline. This 
program influenced thirty-six% of the women clients of the family 
planning clinics to come because of that program. These women did not 
want to fall into the trap and the poverty and all the health problems 
that this teenage mother had fallen into. So they learned from that and 
they went to family planning. As a result of this program here was a 
153% increase in condom distribution.
											</p><p>
																						In Tanzania a radio serial depicted an alcoholic 
truck driver with a girlfriend at every truck stop and a subservient 
wife waiting at home. His wife figured him out during the serial and 
told him she had heard about the AIDS epidemic and said that when he was
 home he was going to have to use condoms. She went on to become an 
entrepreneur and founded her own business, and she became a role model 
for female empowerment.</p><p>

																									</h2><p>	Although the economy and jobs have 
been the "foremost" issues in California's Senate race, Sen. Barbara 
Boxer (D) is "intent on highlighting the distinction" between her views 
on abortion rights and those of her Republican opponent, Carly Fiorina, 
the AP/San Jose Mercury News reports.</p><p>	A new poll from the Public 
Policy Institute of California shows 39% of likely voters support Boxer 
-- who supports abortion rights in early stages of pregnancy -- while 
34% favor Fiorina, who opposes abortion except in cases or rape, incest 
or to save a woman's life.</p><p>Boxer has been endorsed by Planned 
Parenthood Affiliates of California, NARAL Pro-Choice California, 
EMILY's List and the National Organization for Women. Fiorina has 
received endorsements from the antiabortion-rights groups California 
Pro-Life Council, the Susan B. Anthony List and National Right to Life.</p>
	<p>Boxer says she knows that abortion is an issue that "can help drive 
voters her way." A director of the poll said that the issue could work 
in Boxer's favor if she can portray Fiorina's views as a threat to the 
status quo. 53% of Fiorina's supporters consider themselves 
"pro-choice," according to a recent poll.	</p>	</div></div>
