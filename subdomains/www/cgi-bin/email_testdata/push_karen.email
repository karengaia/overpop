OP-ED: Is there enough investment in young people? Date: Saturday,
January 21, 2012
Source: The Lancet
Author: Babatunde Osotimehin

International Youth Day, on Aug 12, 2011, marked the end of the
International Year of Youth, which the UN dedicated to the promotion
of dialogue and mutual understanding between governments and young
people. The occasion created an opportunity to look back and remember
the value of meeting the needs of young people.

Investment in the 1=B78 billion young people aged 10-24 years, who
constitute more than a quarter of the world's population, could change
the lives of present and future generations, and indeed "Change Our
World", the theme of this year's Youth Day.1 Investments are
particularly important in developing countries, where 90% of young
people live.

Yet the response has been far from adequate. Although young people are
able to bring about change, engagement with them has been tokenistic
and sporadic. Young people make up half of the world's unemployed
population and more than half of those living in poverty, but, as of
2010, 44 of 66 countries did not consult with young people when
preparing national poverty reduction strategies.2 Furthermore, only
one in four of these strategies identifies young people as a major
group affected by poverty.2

In view of competing priorities, countries often do not recognise the
importance of young people in economic and social progress and, as a
result, dedicate too few resources to harness their full potential.
This shortage of investment undermines national growth and progress.
To resolve this issue, investments in young people's health and
education are crucial. Health and education affect productivity of the
future workforce and thus the economic growth of nations.2 The
benefits of investment in education, especially secondary education,
are particularly high. For boys, future wages rise by 5-15%. Returns
are even higher for girls: an extra year of education boosts their
future wages by 10-20%.1 Moreover, the positive effect of girls'
education carries over to future generations, resulting in improved
health outcomes for women, their children, and their grandchildren.

Investments in health are crucial to allow young people to reach their
full potential. In turn, this improvement greatly enhances countries'
productivity and prospects for development. Although maternal death
and disability are now largely preventable, complications of pregnancy
and childbirth are still the leading causes of death in the developing
world in girls aged 15-19 years.3 And even if some progress has been
made in halting the spread of HIV in this group, young people
accounted for 41% of new HIV infections in the adult population in
2009.4 The UN Population Fund (UNFPA) is working to expand
age-appropriate sex education, as well as sexual and reproductive
health services that meet the needs of young people.

A key period for investment is adolescence, especially for the poorest
girls who face discrimination because of their age and sex. They are
at high risk of child marriage, early pregnancy, school drop out,
social exclusion, gender-based violence, HIV infection, maternal
illnesses, and death.5 To turn this situation around, UNFPA is forming
partnerships with countries as diverse as Guatemala, Malawi, and
Ethiopia to empower young girls by promoting safe spaces, teaching
leadership programmes, and running life-skills education activities,
with a focus on sexual and reproductive health.

Although progress has been made in education and health, much is left
to do. Despite gains in access to education, 13% of individuals aged
15-24 years in developing countries are illiterate,6 and even those
with basic literacy skills are not prepared for the job markets of a
globalised world. Furthermore, young people have endured the worst
effects of the current economic crisis. In 2009, 81 million young
people were unemployed, the highest number ever recorded.7 Even as the
global economy slowly recovers, young people, and particularly young
women, have difficulty finding jobs. The few economic opportunities
and mechanisms to allow participation in creation of economic and
political agendas have spurred recent revolutions of the Arab Spring
led by young people seeking freedom, social justice, and change.

Clearly, substantial efforts are needed to involve young people in
decision making. Some initiatives are being implemented that could
inspire further action. In Ghana, for example, the non-governmental
organisation Young and Wise has partnered with the Youth Coalition and
UNFPA to incorporate the rights and needs of young people into the
growth and national poverty reduction strategy. This scheme includes
strengthening of young people's capacities to monitor and assess its
implementation, and to hold their government accountable.

As the world population reaches 7 billion, young people's rights and
participation should be at the forefront of international development.
A better world for future generations can be achieved only by
fulfilling human rights and meeting the development needs of the large
generation of young people.

I declare that I have no conflicts of interest.

Unsafe Abortions on the Rise: New Global Analysis Date: Thursday,
January 19, 2012
Source: ABC News (U.S.)
Author: Mikaela Conley

Unsafe abortions are on the rise across the world, according to a new
global analysis by the Guttmacher Institute and the World Health
Organization. And, after a period of significant decline in the global
abortion rate as a whole, researchers found that those numbers had
begun to plateau.

>From 2003 to 2008, the abortion rate per 1,000 women of childbearing age (=
15 to 44) changed slightly, from 29 to 28 per 1,000. women But the proporti=
on of unsafe abortions that took place across the world rose 44 percent in =
1995 to 49 percent in 2008.

"The stall in the abortion rate coincides with a plateau in the level
of contraceptive use, which had been increasing in prior years," said
Dr. Gilda Sedgh, lead author of the study and senior researcher at the
Guttmacher Institute in New York. "Before the abortion rate stalled,
it was declining, and contraceptive use was increasing. Also more
abortions are unsafe because a growing proportion of abortions are
taking place in the developing world."

'Institutionalisation of the Birth Spacing Paradigm': Religious
scholars accept importance of child spacing Date: Friday, January 20,
2012
Source: Daily Times (Pakistan)

The five-year Family Advancement for Life and Health (FALAH) project
undertaken by the Pakistan Population Council (PPC) is nearing
completion with marked acceptance among religious leaders for child
spacing as an important tool to save lives.

Representatives of stakeholders discussing 'Institutionalisation of
the Birth Spacing Paradigm,' on Thursday were highly appreciative of
FALAH Communication and Social Mobilisation strategies to bring about
the much-needed change in the public mindset.

Participants, including senior medical specialists, religious
scholars, government representatives and activists, expressed
satisfaction about growing realisation that couples could be
motivated.

"Couples are keen to plan their family that may benefit them and their
children in terms of health and life quality," said Prof Abdul Ghaffar
Biloo.

The project that was initiated and managed in collaboration with
different NGOs also actively involved healthcare providers, pertaining
to different tiers, said Dr Ali Mohammad Mir, Chief of Party, FALAH.

The USAID sponsored FALAH project is working in 26 different districts
of the country, including Dadu, Ghotki, Jacobabad, Karachi (Lyari,
Gadap and Orangi), Larkana, Sanghar, Shikarpur, Sukkur and Thatta in
Sindh.

Its four major objectives included easy accessibility to facilities
and products needed for child spacing; training of healthcare
providers including family physicians, lady health workers etc;
modifying public behaviour and attitude of stakeholders towards
population welfare; improved understanding of couples about relevant
interventions.

"We have been able to train 30,000 professionals belonging to both
public and private sectors," he said. Dr Mir said the project was
specially focused on meeting the unmet needs of the rural and
semi-urban population with active involvement of sections holding any
influence on them.

"Equal attention is also on discouraging early marriages, particularly
of girls who consequently are at higher risk to either die or suffer
from severe complications," said the chief of party of the project.

Communication expert Javed Jabbar discussed in detail FALAH
Communication and Social Mobilisation strategies, with frequent
display of favourable comments forwarded by known religious scholars
and researchers besides medical experts about relevance of child
spacing.

This was in the country where three women die, every hour, of birth
related complication yet 70 percent couples do not use contraceptives
either due to non availability of required services or due to
associated myths.

Dr Nasrin Khan, AID Project Management Specialist - Health, USAID said
FALAH was one of the signature projects of USAID and its wide
endorsement and acceptance eases the process of adoption by health and
population welfare departments of the country. "They can strengthen
their service delivery structure," said Dr Nasrin.

"The project also makes the task easier for private sector and the
NGOs working to meet quality reproductive healthcare needs of the
people," she said.

Special Secretary for Health Dr Suresh Kumar said impact of FALAH
project in identified districts of the province was tremendous and the
provincial health department was keen to build upon the project.

"This is with particular reference to information, communication and
education materials developed by FALAH," he said. The secretary agreed
that there was a need to sustain the project on stronger lines with
equal focus on rural sector of the province.

Dr Nighat Shah, Secretary General, Society of Obstetrician and
Gynecologists of Pakistan said the national maternal mortality rate of
276 per 1000 is high but higher are these rates in pockets that
represent least developed parts of the country.

She also shared her experience of working in flood relief camps,
during recent years, in the country, where majority of inmates had
little inkling about care any woman can need during her pregnancy.
Many of the women and their spouses said they were keen to have
adequate gap between their children, said the doctor.

"We have to target population that is young and in most productive age
of their lives," said Dr Shah.

The gynaecologist opined that reluctance was not among the targeted
community but perhaps it were the healthcare providers reluctant to be
accessible to people in need.

Dr Zahoor, a family physician from Thatta; Rashida, a lady health
worker; Abdul Fahim a community mobiliser and Moulvi Abdul Basit also
shared their experience with the participants.

Study: Fewer abortions worldwide; increase in unsafe abortions Date:
Thursday, January 19, 2012
Source: CNN (U.S.)
Author: Val Wadas-Willingham

A new study finds that although abortion rates around the world have
leveled off, unsafe abortions across the globe continue to rise.

Researchers noted between 1995 and 2003 the abortion rate per 1,000
women between the ages of 15 to 44 dropped from the 35 to 29
worldwide. But in 2008 the global abortion rate remained the same at
about 28 per every 1,000 women.

Yet alarmingly, researchers say the proportion of abortions thought to
be unsafe rose from 44% in 1995 to 49% in 2008. The study is published
in The Lancet.

According to study authors, an unsafe abortion is defined by the World
Health Organization as a procedure for terminating a pregnancy that is
performed by an individual lacking the necessary training or performed
in an environment that is not up to minimal medical standards.
Researchers took their data from abortion surveys, official worldwide
statistics, hospital records and other published reports.

"These latest figures are deeply disturbing," noted Dr. Richard
Horton, Editor of The Lancet, "The progress made in the 1990s is now
in reverse. Promoting and implementing policies to reduce the number
of abortions is now an urgent priority for all countries and for
global health agencies, such as WHO. Condemning, stigmatizing, and
criminalizing abortion are cruel and failed strategies. It's time for
a public health approach that emphasizes reducing harm -- and that
means more liberal abortion laws, " Horton continued.

The study also found about 78% of all abortions took place in the
developing world in 1995. That number increased to 86% by 2008, even
though the number of women of childbearing age in those countries rose
more slowly.

And even though the abortion rate has declined over the years, the
study found there were 2.2 million more abortions in 2008 (43.8
million) compared with 2003 (41.6 million).

Study authors believe the changes in abortion rates between 1995 and
2008 coincide with a lack of modern contraceptive methods available to
women worldwide. They also noted family planning services don't seem
to be keeping up with the increasing demand by people across the globe
who want to have smaller families and therefore better control of the
timing of births.

Afghan Women: Symbol Of Past Oppression, Future Of Equal Rights Date:
Thursday, January 19, 2012
Source: Forbes.com (U.S.)
Author: Whitney Grespin

As news broke last week of the brutal treatment of 15 year old Sahar
Gul, the young lady sold into an abusive marriage by her brother, the
state of women?s rights in Afghanistan has again come to the fore of
public attention. In the decade since the fall of the Taliban, Afghan
women are still restricted by allowances made by the male-dominated
government and dependent on the protection of men.

Despite international calls for gender equality and integration, the
women of Afghanistan have not yet widely become active players in the
reconstruction of the country but instead symbolize past oppression.
Afghan women need the backing of their men as well as the continued
support of the international community to solidify their role in the
peace, reconciliation, and transition processes that will safeguard
them and their children in the future.

Women?s rights can be an incendiary issue in Afghanistan and has the
ability to fuel feuds, revenge cycles, and civil strife. Although just
a single anecdote, systematic gender discrimination ripples out from
the case of Gul. It has emerged that she escaped her attackers four
months earlier but was returned to the home of her husband by local
authorities, where she was locked in a toilet, beaten, and tortured,
all for refusing to willingly submit to prostitution. Once the
incident gained media attention, Gul?s mother- and sister-in-law were
arrested, while her husband and father-in-law have yet to be detained.

BLOG: U.S. teen pregnancy rate remains highest in developed world
Date: Thursday, January 19, 2012
Source: Los Angeles Times (U.S.)
Author: Shari Roan

Teen pregnancy rates in the United States have fallen in recent years,
but the country still has a higher rate than any other developed
country, according to data released Thursday from the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention.

Battles over how to best prevent teen pregnancy may be to blame for
the continued high rate in the United States. Abstinence-only programs
are favored in some areas while education and improved access to
contraception are supported in others. The most recent controversy
stemmed from the federal government's refusal in December to allow
emergency contraceptive pills to be sold over-the-counter to girls age
16 and younger.

The new data, taken from a survey conducted in 19 states from 2004 to
2008, underscore the problems with access to contraception and
education on how to use contraceptives effectively, the report states.
Half of the teen girls age 15 to 19 who became pregnant were not using
any method of birth control. Among those, 31% said they didn't think
they could get pregnant at the time.

BLOG: New Restrictions On Abortion Almost Tied Record Last Year Date:
Thursday, January 19, 2012
Source: NPR (U.S.)
Author: Julie Rovner

If it seemed like 2011 was a big year for laws restricting abortion, it was=
.

In fact, according to "Who Decides? The Status of Women's Reproductive
Rights In the U.S.," the 21st annual report compiled by the
abortion-rights group NARAL Pro-Choice America, the 69 laws enacted
restricting a woman's reproductive rights were just one short of the
record set in 1999.

"The bottom line here is that elections matter," said NARAL President
and CEO Nancy Keenan. "When you have a change of anti-choice
politicians sitting in the statehouse, it affects women's' lives."

In fact, the dramatic increase in laws restricting abortion and other
reproductive health matters shouldn't have come as much of a surprise
given the results of the 2010 elections, noted NARAL Policy Director
Donna Crane.

Govt moves urgently to expand aged care services Date: Friday, January 20, =
2012
Source: Channel NewsAsia (Singapore)

The government is moving with urgency to expand aged care services to
cope with an expected surge in demand when the pace of ageing in the
population starts to accelerate.

By 2020, it wants to at least double the outreach of home-based
healthcare services - from the current 4,000.

Home-based social care will also be beefed up from the existing 2,000 to 7,=
500.

The Health Ministry will expand the number of day social and
rehabilitative care places - from 2,100 to about 6,200.

It'll also increase manpower and resources to Seniors Activity Centres
to serve up to 48,000 - from the 18,000 seniors served today.

The government wants to build more Seniors Activity Centres, so that
they can reach out to the growing number of vulnerable seniors.

Health Minister Gan Kim Yong announced these plans at a Ministerial
Committee on Ageing dialogue session with stakeholders Friday morning.

He said the government has to act now.

This, as the first cohort of Baby Boomers turns 65 years old this year.

By 2020, some 600,000 people will be above the age of 65, and from
there, the pace of ageing will start to accelerate.

This means 15 per cent of the population will be above 65 years.

"2020 is less than 10 years away. We must be ready when rapid ageing
sets in. Now is the time to gear up and plan ahead - our services, our
infrastructure facilities and our capabilities - to better support the
evolving needs of our growing population of seniors," said Mr Gan.

On its part, the government will not only plan, but act ahead to
prepare for an ageing population.

So the ministry will expand new care services, including stronger
transition care post discharge from hospitals, as well as further
develop transitional convalescence facilities, to rehabilitate
seniors.

Mr Gan also announced plans to ramp up the number of nursing home beds
by some 70 per cent, to 15,600.

He said there will also be a stronger push for home palliative care service=
s.

On its part, the Ministerial Committee on Ageing will review aged care
financing schemes to make aged care more affordable.

The government is also thinking of developing more aged care
facilities like day centres and nursing homes, under a Build-Own-Lease
model.

Mr Gan said the ministry will aggregate demand and develop manpower
for the sector.

To help raise productivity, he's also prepared to work with
stakeholders to study how IT can be maximised.

The Ministerial Committee on Ageing was set up in 2007 to promote
active ageing as Singapore's population rapidly ages.

Author: Mary Graham

FREE condoms are being given to children as young as 13 in schools and
youth clubs.

And now a map showing where they are available will display at the

The app has been created by health professionals who say it is the
best way of reducing sexually transmitted diseases and teenage
pregnancies.

Cornwallis School in Linton and Swadelands School in Lenham are
handing out free condoms to pupils as part of the scheme.

School clinics alongside youth clubs, community centres, pharmacies
and family planning clinics are listed on the Kent C Card scheme,
which has given teenagers aged 13 to 19 information on where to get
free contraception since 2007.

Concerns

Health bosses stress before teenagers are registered, they must have a
face-to-face meeting with a trained adviser. If someone uses the card
20 times, they will need to re-register.

If there were any concerns over the way someone was using their C
Card, or their sexual health, they would be referred to another health
service adviser.

Before the iPhone app, clinics offering free condoms were listed on
the C Card's website.

However, the Kent Community Health Trust, which is responsible for
school nurses, would not say how many condoms had been handed over to
children under 16, saying: "It is information we wouldn't want to
release."

It did say that 45,852 teenagers had registered with the C Card since
it began, though that does not necessarily mean every one of those
youngsters has been given contraception.

Across Kent, there are 36 schools or colleges that work with the trust.

A spokesman added: "We work with governors of the schools to decide
what service will be provided, ranging from condom provision and
advice, chlamydia screening, to a full sexual health clinic."

Ruth Herron, head of sexual health at the trust, said: "This app not
only gives people information about the C Card, it can also point them
immediately in the direction of the nearest outlet to get free
condoms, or advice about their sexual health."

Maidstone is the only place in Kent to show a steady rise in the
numbers of teenagers becoming pregnant in the past few years.

In 2010, there were 98 conceptions among under-18s in Maidstone, with
99 during 2009. The figures go on to reveal that 60 terminations were
carried out in 2010, compared with 51 during 2009.

Neighbouring Tonbridge and Malling saw 72 pregnancies confirmed in
under-18s in 2010, and 45 abortions.

China losing its 'population dividend', experts warn China losing
population dividend, experts warn Date: Friday, January 20, 2012
Source: South China Morning Post
Author: Cary Huang

Demographers and economists are advising Beijing to keep a close watch
on population figures, with the proportion of people of working age
having shrunk last year for the first time in a decade.

Although they insist there is no cause for alarm, they say the data
provides further evidence that the country has lost its "population
dividend" - the notion that nations with younger populations fare
better economically.

Economists cite this factor as being crucial to China's three decades
of phenomenal growth that has established it as the world's second
biggest economy.

The population aged between 15 and 64 - the internationally accepted
range for labour forces - dropped to 74.4 per cent of the total
population last year, a drop of 0.1 percentage points from 2010, the
National Bureau of Statistics said.

The number of people over 60 reached 185 million, accounting for 13.7
per cent of the total and rising 0.47 percentage points. And the
population above 65 hit 123 million, 9.1 per cent of the population -
up 0.25 percentage points.

"Although it is still possible to see some minor fluctuations in the
next few years, it is worth paying much more attention to the impact
[of a decreasing] labour supply," the statistics bureau said.

But analysts also noted that because the population had risen so
quickly, the number of workers had not dropped, despite many baby
boomers born six decades ago dropping out of the work force and the
birth rate falling dramatically under the nation's one-child policy.

Professor Chen Wei , a demographer with Renmin University's Institute
of Population Research, said there was no cause for alarm at the
latest figures.

Chen noted that the labour force was still growing, and that its
growth rate had outpaced that of the ageing population - those above
65 who are not considered part of the labour market.

He also pointed out that the statistics bureau said it was the first
time in 10 years that the workforce, relative to the population, had
declined. This was evidence that the change did not represent a
"turning point" in the job market.

Rather, he said, it resulted from a combination of baby boomers born
in the 1950s, when Mao Zedong promoted a higher birthrate, as well as
from the increasing life expectancy and the sharp drop in fertility
rates in recent decades as a result of modernisation.

But some economists said the decreased proportion of the labour force
provided further evidence of widespread fears in recent years that the
mainland was witnessing a labour shortage and ushering in an ageing
society.

Zhuang Jian , a senior economist with the Asian Development Bank's
China resident mission, said the latest data had at least provided
further evidence of a decade-long trend towards a growing ageing
population and an increasing labour shortage.

"The current labour shortage plaguing many of China's regions,
especially the developed coastal regions, highlights the urgent need
for the government to work out new strategies and policies for [social
and economic] development," Zhuang said. He said the demographic trend
called for a transformation of the development model, as the previous
model, which capitalised on the ample supply of cheap labour, was no
longer viable.

Demographic studies suggest that the elderly will account for more
than 30 per cent of the population by 2040, and that China will face
the biggest ageing-society problem of any country in the world,
exacerbated largely by its one-child policy.

Shrinking spaces leave Mumbai gasping Date: Friday, January 20, 2012
Source: The Times of India
Author: Sukhada Tatke

Mumbai fares poorly on availability of open spaces, compared to cities
in India and the rest of the world. London reportedly has a per capita
open space of 50 sq metres and Delhi has about 14-15 sq metres,
compared to less than two sq metres in Mumbai.

Mumbai, however, has been fighting a losing battle for open spaces
over the last few years thanks to a burgeoning population on one hand
and encroachments on the other.

"Mumbai's open space count is much worse than most metros in the
country. There are hardly any public playgrounds left in the city,
they are either encroached upon or used for other purposes," says
Nayana Kathpalia, co-convenor of NGO CitiSpace.

Open space concerns are being voiced for a long time now. The Bombay
High Court, in a judgment on mill land in 2005, noted kids in the city
may be born with mental and physical infirmities if the oxygen levels
reduce gradually due to lack of open spaces and recreational
facilities.

Mumbai has an abysmal paucity of gardens and playgrounds , leaving the
city of 12.47 million gasping.The appalling ratio of 0.03 acres of
open space for every 1,000 persons is a far cry from London's 12
acres, New York's four acres and Singapore's six acres per 1,000
people.

A look at the big public grounds in different cities shows that Mumbai
lags there as well. New York's Central Park measures 843 acres and
London's Hyde Park is 350 acres. Shivaji Park stands at seven acres.

To compound the problem , Mumbai has a smaller area (437 sq km) than
New York,Tokyo and Jakarta,but a much higher rate of population
growth. This has resulted in a steep rise in the density of the
population concentrated within the island city and its suburbs.

Parents complain that the lack of open spaces in the vicinity forces
them to take kids to malls and multiplexes . "When we were growing up,
there was always space to play. Now, building compounds are taken over
by cars, big grounds no longer exist, beaches are dirty.

It leaves us no option but to allow the kids to watch television or to
take them to malls and movies," says Mulund resident Priyanka Gupta .
Dadar resident Sonali Wagle , who organises trips for children, says,
"These days many schools don't have playgrounds as the extra spaces
have been taken over by additional school buildings . Children are not
actively into sports, which affects their health and thinking ability
as they are mostly confined to the house."

City historian Sharda Dwivedi says, "Open spaces are being taken over
by clubs inaccessible to the public. We don't have access to the sea
except for Gateway of India, Haji Ali, Chowpatty and Marine Drive , or
no wonderful parks to boast of. We have Rani Baug, but there too
somebody wanted to build a fancy zoo. The nexus between builders and
politicians, and overnight changes in laws have contributed to the
situation."

Urban population growth on steady path: Report Date: Friday, January 20, 20=
12
Source: The Times of India
Author: Manish Umbrajkar

Cities like Mumbai, Kolkata, Nagpur have registered a population
growth rate between 10 to 20 % in the last two decades. A similar
trend is seen in Allahabad, Amritsar, Asansol, Dhanbad, Durg,
Jabalpur, Kanpur, Ludhiana, Thiruchirapalli and Varanasi.

This indicates that the growth rate of urban population is heading
towards stabilization, a report by the town and country planning
organisation of the union ministry of urban development has stated.
The decadal growth of population in these areas too has slowed down,
it added.

Based on the provisional population total as per the national census
of 2011, the report has compiled statistics of population growth since
1951. The growth rate of urban population showed that in the last two
decades, the variation of urban population has remained around 31.5 %
and the growth rate of population has slowed down.

Between 1991 to 2001, the decadal growth rate of population was 21.5
%. In the subsequent ten years, between 2001 and 2011, the growth rate
further declined to 17.6 %.

The report also revealed that the number of cities with a population
of ten lakh and more have increased in the last ten years. While there
were 35 such cities in 2001, there are 53 such cities.

The report states that in Kerala, cities like Kozhikode, Kannur,
Kollam, Malapuram, Thrissur have registered a growth rate of more than
100 %. This may not be due to natural increase. The increase has been
mainly due to changes of the boundary of these cities encompassing
vast surrounding rural areas," the report said.

Kerala, Nagaland and West Bengal have registered more than 100 %
increase in the number of towns since 2001 census. On the other hand,
there has not been much increase in the number of towns in states like
Mizoram, Sikkim and Himachal Pradesh. However, a number of rural
settlements have attained urban characteristics and have been
classified as census towns.

Goa is the most urbanized state with 62.17 % urban population,
followed by Mizoram (51.5 %), Tamil Nadu (48.45 %), and Kerala (47.72
%). Maharashtra, which has 45.23 % urban population, ranks 11th.
Karnataka, Punjab, Haryana, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal have not
crossed the 40 % mark. Assam, Bihar and Himachal Pradesh are the least
urbanized. Assam has 14.08 % of urban population, followed by Bihar
(11.3 %) and Himachal Pradesh (10.04 %).

Care and Respect Is a Right for Every Expectant Women At Childbirth
Date: Thursday, January 19, 2012
Source: The New Times (Rwanda)

In this month of January, the White Ribbon Alliance (WRA) is featuring
courteous maternity care by promoting Universal rights of expectant
women.

The motive is to raise awareness of women's rights to civil care
during pregnancy and childbirth.

The White Ribbon Alliance for Safe Motherhood (WRA) is a nonpartisan,
non-profit and non-governmental membership organization that aims at
decreasing both maternal and newborn deaths globally.

Giving birth is one of the most amazing things women can experience
but unfortunately, some women seeking maternity care are treated in a
disrespectful manner and face injustices such as physical assault,
verbal insults, discrimination, abandonment, or detention at the
facilities for failure of payment of medical bills.

Dr Alphose Butoyi, a Gynecologist with Kibagabaga Hospital, in an
interview with The New Times, says that ill treatment towards
expectant mothers yields distrust.

"It's important to be gentle with an expectant mother. Using a
friendly tone and giving them all the attention they need is one way
to go about it. They will definitely have confidence in you," Butoyi
said.

He further adds that pregnant women will only trust you if you give
them all the care they need.

"With extreme attention and care granted, the expectant mother will
take in the advice you give them and believe in whatever you say. In
case of a complicated situation, the relationship built with each
other comes in handy when asking them to comply with what is at hand,"
says Butoyi.

He strongly advises both midwives and gynecologists to be gentle with
expectant mothers because they are so sensitive and ill treatment can
drive them away.

"In this profession we have to naturally be down to earth because
these expectant mothers are going through hormonal and psychological
changes and any slight mistreatment could affect them and the baby,"
Butoyi advises.

Janet Uwamaria, a mother of two appreciates the way she was treated
after being transferred to Kibagaba Hospital from Kagugu Health
Center.

"It was amazing the way the midwife (Immaculate Kantengwa) explained
to me how the cesarean section would be done. Although I had gone for
antenatal checkups at my home area's health center, I didn't expect
the kind of friendly treatment I was offered here," Uwamaria says.

The 25-year-old mother had spent three days at the hospital prior to
the cesarean section and her baby's condition had stabilized as well.

"The baby was so tired after birth that she could not even breastfeed.
I had to continuously tap her so she could wake up and suckle. But now
she is a lot more active," Uwamaria says.

Immaculate Kantengwa, the midwife who attended to Uwamaria, explains
the importance essence of treating mothers during childbirth
respectfully.

"When you're friendly to them, they respect whatever you tell them to
do. For instance during labor, she will do what you tell because she
has confidence in you," Kantengwa said.

She adds that in case of a stillbirth, the midwife has to find a way
to talk to a mother without adding more pain to her distress.

"To make a mother understand that you feel her pain in a friendly way
proves that you did your best in trying to save the baby. It's
advisable to approach all matters with a calm and low tone," she
emphasizes.

She says that watching a happy mother carry her healthy baby in her
arms is amazing.

"Most mothers bring their children to me months later and show me how
much they have grown. This gesture is built through the relationship
created based on the way I treated them and it keeps me going," says
Kantengwa.

Kibagaba Hospital has become a referral hospital for several Health
Centers that transfer complicated cases of expectant mothers.

Josephine Bazubagira, a resident of Rutonde Village, Shyorongi in
Rulindo District, Northern Province, said she had contractions for
three days before she was transferred to Kibagabaga Hospital.

"I was transferred for a cesarean section but when I reached the
hospital, they were still organizing the material used for the
operation. Then suddenly I got contractions and gave birth naturally,"
Bazubagira narrates.

Besides the friendly treatment she got, she also acknowledges the
importance of Mutuelle de Sante, the Public Health Insurance that
Rwandans use.

"Thanks to Mutuell de sant=E9, I'm going to pay probably Rwf3,000. I
advise everyone to embrace the community health insurance especially
if you're a low income earner," she says.

Mutuelle de Sante is a government initiated community health insurance
policy put in place to facilitate Rwandans in accessing health
services at cheaper costs.

China says working age population fell in 2011 Date: Thursday, January 19, =
2012
Source: Agence France Presse

The proportion of China's population that is of working age fell last
year for the first time since 2002, the National Bureau of Statistics
said, as the country struggles with a labour shortage.

The proportion of people aged between 15 and 64 dropped 0.10
percentage points to 74.4 percent, but the decline underscores the
problems faced by the world's most populous country as its workforce
shrinks.

"It is only a small shift, but there is a need to place much
importance on the labour issue," said the NBS in a statement issued on
Wednesday and reported by Chinese media on Thursday.

China's vast worker pool has powered the explosive growth of its
export driven economy over the past decade, but analysts say the
labour supply is tightening up.

However, with fewer people available for certain jobs workers have
become louder in calling for better wages and the country has seen
growing instances of unrest.

A series of strikes across China have taken place since November, as
workers protest low salaries, wage cuts and poor conditions.

In the latest industrial action, about 2,000 steel workers in
Sichuan's provincial capital of Chengdu walked off the job earlier
this month to protest against low salaries, according to the US-based
rights group China Labor Watch.

The shortage is the result of demographic changes due to China's
one-child policy, introduced two decades ago.

The NBS said the proportion of people aged over 65 rose by 0.25
percentage points to 9.1 percent in 2011.

UN Population Fund distributes P1.2-million hygiene kits to mothers
Date: Thursday, January 19, 2012
Source: Philippines News Agency (PNA)

The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) distributed on Thursday
some P1.2-million worth of hygiene kits to pregnant and lactating
mothers who were affected by tropical storm Sendong here and some
parts of the province of Negros Oriental last December 17.

The donations were received by the beneficiaries themselves during
simple rites graced by local government unit officials.

In this city, 335 pregnant and lactating mothers received the hygiene
kits from UNFPA representatives headed by Dysezebel Lado in the
presence of Vice Mayor Alan Gel Cordova, Councilor JJ Esmena, city
health officer Dr. Ma. Sarah Talla, social welfare officer Marina
Mendoza and Governor Roel Degamo.

In an interview, Lado said UNFPA has identified a total of 1,585
recipients who were severely affected by Sendong and were living in
evacuation centers. The rapid assessment was conducted by the agency
upon the request of Gov. Degamo two days after "Sendong" hit the
province last month.

One set consists of a "malong" or sari that can be used as a blanket,
sanitary pads, underwear, toothbrush with toothpaste, laundry soap, a
flashlight with battery, slippers, pail, and other toiletries.

Arlene Alano, UNFPA communications officer said, normally after a
calamity, when food, shelter and clothing are already addressed, the
needs of pregnant and lactating mothers are overlooked. Hence, the
agency is focusing their intervention on them to prevent diseases and
infections in evacuation centers.

She said this is far more important because "we are talking here of
two lives, that of the mother and the child inside her womb".

Gov. Degamo made the request to prevent further loss of lives in
hoping for a zero mortality rate among pregnant and lactating mothers
affected by the tropical storm. (PNA)

Women first in quota churn for poll Date: Friday, January 20, 2012
Source: The Times of India
Author: Ambika Pandit

Women will lead from the front when the Delhi Election Commission
notifies 50% quota in the three new corporations later this month. In
fact, the reservation formulae gives the women an edge as they will
get additional seats in both general and SC categories in South and
East Delhi Municipal Corporations to achieve the 50% mandate.

Delhi Election Commissioner Rakesh Mehta held a meeting with all
national political parties to discuss the formula and sought their
views. There was consensus on reserving the first of the 272 seats for
women. However, representatives from both the BJP and the Congress
demanded transparency in the quota system.

According to the formula, Scheduled Caste category seats will be
reserved first. Wards will be selected on the basis of percentage of
SC population . Each Assembly constituency has four wards. And not
more than one ward will be reserved for SC category.

With 19% residents of North Delhi Municipal Corporation belonging to
the SC population , 20 seats of 104 wards will go to the reserved
category . As 50% quota for women will be the new mantra, 10 of 20
seats will go to them.

Fifteen of the 104 wards will go to SC candidates in South Delhi
Municipal Corporation as 14% of the total population belongs to the
reserved category. Eight of 15 seats will go to women. Here women will
get an edge over men with an advantage of one seat.

East Delhi Corporation will have 11 of 64 wards reserved for SCs. Of
these, six will go to women. The area is home to 17% SC population.

After SC seats are reserved , the Delhi Election Commission will
segregate these from the general category . The general seats will
then be reserved starting with the first seat getting assigned to a
woman. While ward numbers may vary, a temporary series starting from 1
will be assigned and odd numbers will be assigned to women.

In the North Delhi corporation with 84 seats falling outside the SC
category, equal number of seats will be reserved for men and women. In
south, of the 89 seats outside the SC category, 45 will go to women as
50% quota is unachievable . In east, of the 53 seats, women will get
27.

A closer look at the arrangement reveals the framework that will
emerge finally will throw up assembly seats with varied profiles. In
some, two or three seats may get reserved for women and in others ,
three may be for men and one for women.

The commission will now finalize the proposal. The notification will,
however, have to wait as the Delhi government is yet to delegate the
power to the commission.

Quota call

Poll panel discusses formula to reserve 50% of 272 seats for women in
three new corporations Notification of reserved seats by Jan-end .
Elections likely in first week of April First seat in all three to be
reserved for women North Delhi Corporation to have 20 seats reserved
for SC candidates.

Of this, 10 will go to women 15 seats to go to SCs in South Delhi
Corporation. Eight seats will go to women East Delhi Corporation will
have 11 seats for SC candidates. Of these, six will be for women
Remaining seats in each corporation will be given a temporary series
number Quota formula: No. 1 seat will go to a woman, followed by a man
for second seat and so on Same formula to be adopted for reserving SC
seats for women

Sex ratio worst in Gujarat cities Date: Friday, January 20, 2012
Source: Times of India
Author: Bharat Yagnik

Two cities of Gujarat,both industrial hubs,top the list of cities with
lowest sex ratio in India.Vapi,the industrial town in south
Gujarat,has got the lowest sex ratio in the country with only 734
women per 1,000 men.Diamond city Surat is the second with 754 women
per 1,000 men.In Vapi,of the 1.63 lakh population,there are 94,338 men
against which there are only 69,267 women.

In 0-6 age group,the ratio is comparatively better at 870 girls per
1,000 boys.The town,known in Asia for a large number of industrial
units,especially chemical units,has 19,899 children in this age
group.In fact,the town is a reverse reflection of the situation
prevailing in Mehsana which has the lowest child sex ratio of 760
while the sex ratio is comparatively better at 893 women per 1,000
men.Diamond city Surat,also known for its high number of
immigrants,has 754 women per thousand men.

Valsad district collector CL Patel said that the low number of women
in the town is a reflection of the high number of migrants who have
made the town their home for earning a living."Over 50% of Vapi's
population constitutes of migrants from other states who work in the
industrial units,mainly small-scale chemical factories.In Vapi,there
are homes where 10-12 men live in a single room," said
Patel.Curiously,the town has a 100% literacy rate,as per the Census
2011 figures.This is one fact which even took the collector by
surprise."I was not aware of this figure," Patel said.

Social scientists say that Vapi's lowest sex ratio in the country has
to be because of the high number of migrants.Times View Vapi
epitomizes the boom towns of Gujarat where the money-order economy
rules.Migrants come to this desi El Dorado,leaving their families
behind,to earn enough to save and send back to their families.If
Mehsana has the lowest child sex ratio and Vapi the lowest urban sex
ratio among urban centres in the country,these are enough indicators
of the lopsided growth taking place in Gujarat.

Race Against Gender Violence Date: Thursday, January 19, 2012
Source: Tanzania Daily News

Mkombozi Vocational Training and Community Development Center (MVTCDC)
in collaboration with the other organizations including tourism
company based in Moshi, Zara Tours have recently organized a 6-kms
charity walk of conveying the message against gender-based violence
(GBV) against women and children in Kilimanjaro region as well as
raising the money for the 30-needy youths.

Speaking with the 'Woman Magazine' during an interview over the event
recently, the founder and Director of the center Ms. Asha Mshana said
that, apart from fundraising the money for the 30 youth who are in the
needy; the charity walk also aimed at creating awareness among the
people in the community on the importance of helping the people who
are in the needy particularly vulnerable and marginalized youth, to
provide life skills, vocational training and self-reliance education
to the youth so particularly marginalized and vulnerable ones so that
to become autonomous.

"The event also aimed at commune the needy youth with the government
and other charity organizations by involving them in decision making
and problem solving in the areas of skills development, poverty
alleviation, reduction of communicable diseases, human rights
awareness, gender equality, sustainability in the community and
environmental consciousness..." she explained.

According to Ms. Mshana, through those activities people could gain
knowledge which is useful in the establishment of small 'poverty
eradication projects' in their areas, hence reducing poverty from one
people to another. The main aim of establishing MVTCDC she added is
poverty eradication among the people in society by giving them 'self
reliance knowledge which they can use to improve their living
standards.

"The centre was started as a CBO (a community based membership
organization) where members work together to cultivate skills, to
liberate themselves in all social and economic oppression, to create
positive change." Ms. Mshana explained. According to her, there are
many objectives that her centre faces, but most of them are to develop
a free community healthy information centre which will address health
concerns, by provide information and promote advocacy for community
health and education needs.

"As I have told before, providing quality skills education for youth
to promote self-reliance so that to eradicate poverty is our motto."
She instated. She added "We also encourage and promote out of school
youth with different talents under their well formed organization,
Mkombozi Youth group (MYG).

Here, the youth are trained different arts works such as Drumming,
dancing, and they earn some money from the shows which they made." She
named some challenges that her organization faces as lack of funds to
help the needy people as the number of them is big than the
organization's ability.

"Due to the poor economic situation of Tanzanian, the centre faces
financial constrains as some parents fail to pay for their children
and the centre has to find means of offsetting running costs by doing
income generating activities like rice and maize farming for food and
sale, catering services, entertainments, tailoring and arts."

Ms. Mshan explained. She added that, the centre has to look for
supports in different ways to meet its goals. Voluntarism, commitment
and networking are the solution for Mkombozi VTCDC success. MVTCDC is
a registered non profit making organization since 1999, and registered
in 2005. It is located at Pasua, sub skirts of Moshi Municipality.

The centre was initiated by a retired home Economics teacher, Ms. Asha
K. Mshana who mobilized retrenched and retired personnel in home
economics, hotel services, computer knowledge, nutritionist, nurses,
agriculturalists for training youth and women in skill development for

Women Fight for Their Rights Over Land Date: Thursday, January 19, 2012
Source: Tanzania Daily News

Thirty six year old Grace Bbayu, a resident of Mvumi village in Dodoma
lost her husband in 2002. All of a sudden she was widowed and thought
her plight was one of the worst blows in her life. Little did she know
more was yet to come. Still mourning her partner's loss, her property
was confiscated by her in-laws, leading to months of suffering which
drove her to the point of despair.

Hope unexpectedly came from a neighbour, who had attended training on
women's rights coordinated by a Non Government Organisation, Women
Wake Up (WOWAP). The neighbour advised Bbayu to visit their offices.
WOWAP has a paralegal unit that gives legal help to women like Bbayu.
The NGO manages a three year project 'Women's Access to Land' funded
by the Civil Society Foundation. With assistance from lawyers at
WOWAP, Bbayu got her property back- and this gave her a fresh start in
life for her five children and herself.

Speaking to 'Daily News' in Dodoma, Bbayu said many more widows wallow
in poverty, as traditionally they are not allowed to inherit land -a
critical resource in the production of food. Bbayu's neighbour, Fatuma
Ali, said there were many cases, where women, having lost their
husbands had their property confiscated, land inclusive by their
in-laws, leaving the widow and orphans homeless. The alternatives are
either to return to their parents' homes or live a destitute life
fighting to survive.

"In our traditional setting we did not have any rights over property.
As a result we the women suffered marginalisation, "she said while
resting her small frame on a table. "On the contrary, she adds,
everything pertaining to tilling the land is a woman's business," she
said. Forty three year old Fatuma, who has used her knowledge to form
groups of women across the area, said education conducted by village
councils and civil societies has enlightened hundreds of women.

"Widows had no where to run to and suffered in silence," she said.
Customs that deny women ownership of and use of land have been
outlawed by the Land Act. Education and information from WOWAP, seeks
to reinforce women's rights in regards to inheritance and the
acquisition of family land. "The campaigns are carried out to
discourage and end cultural practices that bar women from inheriting
land and to encourage citizens to write wills so as to avoid conflicts
over inheritance," says WOWAP Director Fatuma Tawfiqu.

"Government and civil society have to do more. Society needs to start
seeing women people who contribute immensely to economic growth by
owning and controlling land," she said. As stated in the Land Laws,
people can now go and have their land disputes solved at village
council level. Tawfiqu says the radical move, which initially faced
resistance from members of the community who did not want change were
gradually won over. More women armed themselves with knowledge on land
rights.

"We have to right the cultural and social economic wrongs that hinder
the economic progress of women and other traditionally disadvantaged
groups, in Tanzania", Tawfiqu said. Girls are now considered
stakeholders of family land. Early marriage for women, she noted, is
an issue the government is confronting with the view to empower the
female child in that respect as well. "That low social and educational
status of women in some societies prevents them from making
decisions," she said.

Tawfiqu describes the developments as historic and important and
congratulated village councils for fronting this cause that ensures
equal rights to land for both men and women. In Tanzania women to
produce at least 80 per cent of the country's food and 90 per cent of
their labour is channelled towards food production and processing. In
the past Tanzanian women only held slightly over one per cent of land
titles yet they form over 80 per cent of the workforce in the
agricultural sector.

Based on the Land Act 1999, there is room for joint or spousal
registration and documentation of land rights. "Before selling such
land, the seller is required to produce evidence-spousal consent- that
the decision had been agreed upon by his or her partner," Tawfiqu
says. Under the project, WOWAP has conducted training on legal rights
in four villages namely, Makangwa, Kipanga, Mtikila and Zanka. The
major challenges faced were having to win over people who strongly
believe in the patriarchal system, an impediment for women seeking
justice.

Tawfiqu however notes that there are people who were positive to
change. An example is a 70 year old man at Mkunza village in Dodoma
district got training on land rights and legal literacy. He has become
a trainer in neighbouring communities and this has solved many land
and marriage conflicts. Burton Mwidowe, 40, one of the beneficiaries
of the trains fellow trainers at Mvumi. Mwidowe says the programme
funded by Foundation for Civil Society, has helped communities
interpret the Land Act of 1999.

Starting out with a group of 25 trainees, in Makangwa village, he says
that their major challenge ahead is to confront the problem

of land and marriage conflicts. "People were involved in endless land
conflicts, but after getting educated on land laws, conflicts are now
solved more amicably," he says. After sharing information on the Land
Laws, they formed land conflict councils in different villages so as
to solve land issues in the villages. "People now bring forward cases
when they have the right information," he says.

The trainers advise couples not to cohabit but get legally married, so
as avoid conflicts over legal land ownership. Recently, William and
Joyce Tupa both 70, from Makangwa village were legally married,
following the sensitisation of land laws. "People came to learn that
if they are in a legal marriage, their rights are clear-cut," he says.
The on educating communities has taken him to Mlowa, Mvumi, Makuru,
Nkulabi, Iringa Mvumi, working with Ward land conflict councils,
village land conflict councils conducting seminars.

WOWAP's main aim is to educate society at large on the aspects of
human rights, women and children rights. In this particular project
WOWAP uses paralegals. From the analysis of data collected during
monitoring and evaluation visit, it was found that 20 people from each
village were trained as paralegals and they in turn educated 847 men
and 909 women.

Risky sex, drug acts decline in US: survey Date: Thursday, January 19, 2012
Source: Agence France Presse

High-risk sexual behaviors and drug habits that can increase a
person's likelihood of getting HIV/AIDS are on the decline in the
United States, according to a government survey released Thursday.

The number of Americans who said they had more than five sex partners
in the past year, failed to use a condom, had sex in exchange for
drugs or money, used illicit drugs, had male-to-male sex or had an HIV
positive partner all dropped slightly from 2006-2010 compared to 2002.

About 10 percent of men and eight percent of women in the current
survey period reported at least one of these HIV-risk behaviors, down
from 13 percent of men and 11 percent of women in 2002.

That means about 6.5 million men and 4.9 million women reported
HIV-risk related behaviors in the year prior to taking the latest
survey.

The report, issued by the National Center for Health Statistics, drew
from a survey of 22,682 people aged 15-44, most of whom answered
questions by entering responses into a computer rather than to a live
interviewer.

This method "has been found to yield more complete reporting of
sensitive behaviors," said the report.

Nationwide, new cases of HIV have leveled off at about 50,000 in the
United States each year, with 16,000 people dying annually of AIDS,
the Centers for Disease Control said.

About 1.2 million people in the United States are living with HIV, and
about 20 percent do not know they are HIV positive.

Thursday's report said that 61 percent of new AIDS infections in 2009
were among men who have sex with men, while 27 percent were attributed
to heterosexual contact and nine percent to injection of illicit
drugs.

Men who had prison experience in the past year were most likely to
report at least one risky behavior -- 27 percent -- compared to seven
percent of men who had not done time behind bars.

Men with military experience were also less likely (6.8 percent) than
men without (10 percent) to report risky behavior.

Increase in unsafe abortions 'deeply disturbing' Date: Thursday,
January 19, 2012
Source: Asian News International

A rising proportion of abortions worldwide are putting women's health
at risk, a new study has said.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) study suggests that global
abortion rates are steady, at 28 per 1,000 women a year.

However, the proportion of the total carried out without trained
clinical help rose from 44 percent in 1995 to 49 percent in 2008.

The Lancet, which carried the report, said the figures were "deeply disturb=
ing".

Unsafe abortion is one of the main contributors to maternal death
worldwide, and refers to procedures outside hospitals, clinics and
surgeries, or without qualified medical supervision.

Women are more vulnerable to dangerous infection or bleeding in these
environments.

In developing countries, particularly those with more restrictive
abortion laws, most abortions are unsafe, with 97 percent of abortions
in Africa described this way.

To compile the figures, often a difficult task in countries where
abortion is illegal, the researchers used surveys, official statistics
and hospital records.

They concluded that while the abortion rate had fallen since 1995,
that drop had now levelled off, and overall, the rise in world
population meant that there were 2.2 million more abortions in 2008
compared with 2003.

In the developed world, the proportion of pregnancies ending in
abortion fell from 36 percent in 1995 to 26 percent in 2008.

Countries with restrictive abortion laws did not have a corresponding
decrease in abortion rate - in some cases, the reverse was true.

"Unsafe abortion is one of the five major contributors to maternal
mortality, causing one in every seven or eight maternal deaths in
2008," the BBC quoted Beverly Winikoff, from Gynuity, a New York
organisation which pushes for access to safer abortion as writing in
the Lancet.

"Yet, when abortion is provided with proper medical techniques and
care, the risk of death is negligible and nearly 14 times lower than
that of childbirth.

"The data continue to confirm what we have known for decades - that
women who wish to terminate unwanted pregnancies will seek abortion at
any cost, even if it is illegal or involves risk to their own lives,"
he added. (

Aspirin may play role in ridding HIV-infected women of cervical cancer
Date: Thursday, January 19, 2012
Source: Asian News International

Aspirin should be evaluated for its ability to prevent development of
cervical cancer in HIV-infected women, a new study has suggested.

According to the new study, conducted by NewYork-Presbyterian
Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center global health investigators and
cancer specialists in New York, Qatar and Haiti, this simple and
inexpensive solution has the potential to provide enormous benefit for
women in the Caribbean, Latin America and Africa, who suffer from a
disproportionately high rate of cervical cancer death.

Preventive aspirin use could be especially useful in Haiti, where
invasive cervical cancer is a common cause of death in HIV-infected
women. The country also has the highest reported incidence of cervical
cancer in the world and one of the highest HIV infection rates in the
Western Hemisphere.

"These young patients-many of whom were mothers and the sole support
for their families-had worked hard to have their HIV controlled with
antiretroviral therapy, only to develop and die from cervical cancer,"
Daniel Fitzgerald, the study leader, said.

"The results of this collaborative effort will make a real difference
for women living in one of the poorest nations in the world.

"It is wonderful that clinicians and scientists from different parts
of the world were able to come together to address such a critical
issue of care," he said.

For the study, the researchers examined levels of COX-2 and PGE-M (a
stable metabolite of PGE2) in three groups of women and found
increased levels of both molecules in 13 women who were co-infected
with HIV and HPV. COX-2 and PGE-M were also elevated in 18
HIV-infected women with a negative HPV test and lowest in 17
HIV-negative women who also were not infected with HPV.

The researchers discovered that HIV induces expression of the
COX-2/prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) inflammatory pathway in cervical tissue
samples from Haitian women who were infected with HIV.

The findings tie two known facts together - that HIV causes chronic
inflammation, and that PGE2, which is elevated during inflammation, is
linked to cancer development in a number of tumour types, including
cervical cancer.

The researchers also said that the fact that HIV ramps up production
of PGE2 in cervical tissue was not known before this study.

This may help explain why HIV-positive women are five times more
likely to develop invasive cervical cancer than HIV-negative women. It
also suggests that inhibitors of the COX-2 molecule (which contributes
to the production of PGE2) might break the link between HIV and
cervical cancer. Aspirin is one of the cheapest and most effective COX
inhibitors.

"The findings in this study provide new insights into the link between
viral infection and inflammation, two known drivers of cancer
development," Andrew Dannenberg, senior author of the study, said.

The findings of the study demonstrate that HIV infection is associated
with increased cervical COX-2 and elevated systemic PGE2 levels, says
Dr. Fitzgerald. Co-infection with HPV adds to the cervical cancer
risk. Future studies will seek to define the population of women that
may benefit from daily use of aspirin or related inhibitors.

The study has been recently published in the journal Cancer Prevention Rese=
arch.

30% marriages in Pakistan fall into child marriage category Date:
Thursday, January 19, 2012
Source: The Baluchistan Times (Pakistan)

It is estimated that 30 percent of all marriages in the country fall
into the category of child marriages and statistics reveal that
highest rate of such weddings is prevalent in Interior Sindh.

Participants of a media workshop on Child Marriages discussed these
figures here on Wednesday, adding, each day more than 25,000 young
girls become child brides, joining almost 60 million girls who have
married before their 18 birthday globally.

The workshop was organized by Rahnuma-Family Planning Association of
Pakistan (FPAP) in collaboration with AusAid.

Chief Executive Officer Rahnuma-FPAP, Syed Kamal Shah, chairing the
workshop said the issue of child marriages have long been ignored by
the policy makers and other key decision makers in the country.

He informed that child brides are at a highest risk of sexual and
physical abuse, reproductive health complications, HIV/AIDS infections
and other adverse physiological and social outcomes.

In developing countries, Syed Kamal said, complications during
pregnancy or childbearing has become the leading cause of death for
girls aged 15-19.

Director Adolescent and Women Empowerment Rahnuma-FPAP, Amna Akhsheed,
giving a detailed briefing on 'Child Rights as Human Rights Violation'
apprised the participants that it is one of the most wide-spread human
rights violation that exits in the country.

"It is reinforced by customs that commodify young girls", she said
adding, girls from poor households are more likely to be married as
children.

The physical, social and emotional consequences of child marriages are
multiple and severe, which range from high rates of female poverty,
lack of access to education, leading to limited literacy and
employment opportunities, exposed to unprotected sexual relations,
pregnancy and child birth before being physically or psychologically
ready, she said.

In Pakistan, legally, Child Marriages are prohibited under the Child
Marriage Restraint Act 1929, (CMRA) which emphasis that the minimum
age of marriage is 16 years for female and 18 years for males, Amna
stated.

Whoever, being a male above 18 years of age, contracts child marriage
shall be punishable with simple imprisonment which may extend to one
month, or with fine which may extend to Rs. 1000, or with both. What
is worse is that a conviction under this law does not serve to nullify
the marriage, she remarked.

A large number of civil society representatives, media persons and
other stake holders working on the issue attended the workshop while a
short documentary on prevalence of child marrying was also screened.

Many BHUs lack maternal health services: report Date: Thursday, January 19,=
 2012
Source: Daily Times (Pakistan)

A report issued by Free and Fair Election Network (FAFEN) said some
maternity services were found lacking in Basic Health Units (BHUs)
observed in December 2011. The report was issued on Wednesday.

FAFEN governance monitors visited 133 BHUs in 87 districts nationwide,
65 in 34 districts of Punjab, 28 in 21 KP districts, 24 in 16
districts of Sindh, 13 in as many districts in Balochistan and three
in FATA. The report said more than 42 percent BHUs lacked maternity
beds, a third didn't have labour rooms, and 25 percent were without
delivery kits. However, at least 80 percent of the BHUs had women
staff to treat female patients and had advisory services for nursing
mothers.

At least 60 percent of the health units in each region did not have
wheel chairs while at least a third lacked stretchers and 26 percent
were without sterilisers. 25 BHUs nationwide, of which 15 were in KP,
did not have syringe cutters. Similarly, 44 percent of the facilities
lacked working oxygen tents and 90 percent lacked generators for power
backup.

The report said 71 percent of the observed BHUs did not have mini
laboratories for conducting medical tests ? half of them in Sindh and
at least 70 percent in all other regions. With regard to physical
infrastructure, at least 80 percent of these health units had boundary
walls, were accessible by a proper road, housed in good buildings and
95 percent of the facilities were found to be clean. On the other
hand, 81 out of the total 133 BHUs monitored did not have telephone
landline connections ? at least 50 percent in each region. Moreover,
Sui gas connections were also lacking in all three BHUs observed in
FATA and at least 90 percent in each region.

A third of the monitored BHUs did not have arrangements for clean
drinking water for patients, 28 percent lacked washrooms with running
water for patients and a fifth did not have proper shaded waiting
areas for patients.

Developing world sees rise in unsafe abortions Date: Thursday, January 19, =
2012
Source: The Globe and Mail (Canada)
Author: Geoffrey York

After declining for nearly a decade, the world's abortion rate has
stalled since 2003, while a growing percentage of abortions are
dangerous to women's health, especially in Africa, a new study says.

The study found that the abortion rate is actually lower in places
where abortion is legal, such as South Africa, suggesting that
anti-abortion laws may be ineffective and even counter-productive.

Abortion is criminalized or highly restricted in most of Africa, and
not coincidentally Africa is the site of about half of all deaths
caused by unsafe abortions, according to the study published in The
Lancet, the British medical journal.

As abortion declines dramatically in the developed world, it continues
to remain common in the developing world. About a quarter of
pregnancies end in abortions in the developed world today - down from
36 per cent in 1995 - yet the abortion rate in the developing world is
essentially unchanged since 1995, with about a fifth of pregnancies
still ending in abortion.

The study shows that the world is failing to tackle the epidemic of
unsafe abortions, one of the most preventable causes of maternal
deaths, and it suggests that the unavailability of contraception is a
growing problem in much of the world, analysts said.

Unsafe abortion is one of the five major causes of the estimated
365,000 maternal deaths in the world every year.

More than eight-million women need medical attention for complications
caused by unsafe abortions annually, according to the United
States-based Guttmacher Institute, which specializes in reproductive
health issues.

"Almost the entire global burden of deaths due to abortion occurs in
Africa, Asia and Latin America," said an editorial in The Lancet that
accompanied the new study.

?Passing laws is just the first step. It is of no use until it is
implemented properly,? Valerie Khan, the Acid Survivors Foundation
chairperson said on Thursday.

Khan was referring to the Acid Control and Acid Crime Prevention Bill
2010 while addressing a seminar organised by Mumkin Alliance, an
umbrella organisation of 16 bodies working towards elimination of
violence against women.

The seminar, organised in collaboration with South Asia
Partnership-Pakistan, aimed at discussing gender sensitive legislation
against violence against women (VAW) in Lahore.

Begum Zakia Shahnawaz, advisor to chief minister, assured the
