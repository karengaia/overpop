U.S.: HOUSE AIMS THE BUDGET AX AT SOCIAL WELFARE PROGRAMS Date:
Saturday, February 19, 2011
Source: Inter Press Service (Johannesburg)
Author: Aprille Muscara

With a 2015 deadline fast approaching to meet a collective global
promise to tackle poverty and improve education, health and
environmental sustainability around the world, development and
humanitarian advocates are up in arms over conservative lawmakers'
proposals to slash and burn entire chunks of the United States'
foreign aid budget.

After days of heated floor debate and some 600 amendments, the U.S.
Republican- controlled House of Representatives passed what is called
a "Continuing Resolution" (CR) Friday that allocates government
funding from the first week of March until the end of the fiscal year,
which ends on Sept. 30, 2011. The final vote was 235 to 189, with just
three Republicans joining Democrats in opposition.

The CR makes over 61 billion dollars worth of cuts - including about
19 percent to international affairs accounts, according to
calculations by the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition, and 41 percent
to humanitarian aid, according the State Department, compared to FY
2010 enacted funds. Spread over six months, these reductions would be
"devastating" critics say.

As the CR now moves to the Democrat-led Senate, where it is likely to
get watered down some, and with President Barack Obama's threat to
veto the House's proposal if it lands on his desk, the massive purges
in their current form are unlikely. Still, observers worry that deep
slashes will remain and predict an equally contentious battle over the
administration's FY 2012 budget proposal released Monday.

"Let me be clear, the United States of America has been, and will
remain, the global leader in providing assistance," U.S. President
Barack Obama said in his speech at the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs) summit at the United Nations last fall. "We will not abandon
those who depend on us for life- saving help. We keep our promises,
and honour our commitments."

But critics say that the CR threatens these very promises and
commitments, and worry that important global development gains could
be threatened. (See the sidebar for how these cuts could impact the
eight goals).

While certain countries and indicators lag behind in the global MDG
campaign, hundreds of millions of people have been lifted above the
1.25 dollars per day poverty line and universal enrolment in primary
school education has risen steadily in the past two decades.

Most promising are advances made in global health. According to the
Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, deaths due to
malaria could be eradicated and a new generation born without HIV by
2015. If achieved, these successes would represent two of the greatest
health triumphs of our lifetime.

The U.S. is one of the world's top donors. "Because of U.S. aid, over
the last 60 years, maternal and child mortality have dropped sharply,
literacy rates have increased and economic opportunities have expanded
in the developing world," said CARE president and CEO Dr. Helene D.
Gayle in a statement Wednesday.

"These funds produce real change in the lives of women and children
and their families living in extreme poverty, changing entire
communities and nations for the better," she argued.

If colossal cuts are made to Washington's foreign aid budget,
observers are concerned about the impact this could have on global
health and development and also fear a potential ripple effect to
other donor countries' provision of aid if the U.S. reneges on its
commitments as a result of these budget cuts.

"The House FY 2011 funding bill would have a devastating impact on
U.S. foreign affairs funding, and if adopted could be a serious
setback too U.S support for the Millennial Development Goals (MGDs),"
Don Kraus, chief executive officer for Citizens for Global Solutions,
told IPS by e- mail.

"The legislation would cut funding for critical poverty fighting food
aid programs by up to 50 percent, decimate support for refugees in
Africa, Burma, Iraq and other places, and shrink funding for fighting
AIDS, Malaria and Tuberculosis," he explained. "This legislation
represents a serious retreat for U.S. poverty reduction efforts."

Some analysts argue that the House's CR will threaten U.S. interests,
security and reputation abroad, don't create the jobs that were
promised and do little to tackle this year's 1.4 trillion dollar
deficit.

"The House FY11 funding bill targets U.S. spending on international
affairs and poverty relief, calling it 'deficit reduction'," Kraus
told IPS. "But fiscally this would have the same impact as withholding
my daughter's allowance to pay down our family's mortgage."

Kraus cited a November 2010 public opinion poll conducted by the
Programme on International Policy Attitudes at the University of
Maryland. "Americans and many politicians do not understand how little
we actually spend and believe 25 percent of the federal budget is
spent on foreign aid," he said.

"When asked what would be a reasonable amount to spend, the median
response is 10 percent. In fact, only a little over one percent of our
budget goes to foreign assistance," Kraus explained.

In contrast, the defence budget amounts to about 22 percent of federal
spending. In the House's CR, about 526 billion dollars would be
allocated to the Pentagon, just slightly below the 540 billion
Secretary Robert Gates requested.

"These were hard decisions, and I know many people will not be happy
with everything we've proposed in this package," House Appropriations
Committee chair Hal Rogers said in a statement last Friday, when the
CR was introduced. "That's understandable and not unexpected, but I
believe these reductions are necessary to show that we are serious
about returning our nation to a sustainable financial path."

Impact on Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) 1-4

MDG 1-End extreme poverty and hunger: Development Assistance (DA)
would be slashed by 30 percent; International Disaster Assistance by
67 percent; aid for migration and refugees by 45 percent; and overall
humanitarian and poverty- focused funding by 27 percent, according to
InterAction. These accounts largely assist the world's poorest. And
according to the World Food Programme, proposed cuts to food aid would
take away school meals from approximately 2.5 million children; leave
15 million individuals - mostly women and children - hungry in
conflict and disaster situations; and reverse a decade of steady gains
by slashing food aid to their 2001 levels.

MDG 2-Achieve universal primary education: "Cutting school meals
programmes makes it hard for children, especially girls, to stay in
school and get an education," the WFP says. Educational and Cultural
Exchange Programmes would also be slashed by 133.7 million dollars, or
21.1 percent, compared to funds enacted in FY 2010. One of these
programmes supports elementary and secondary schools in 20
Muslim-predominated countries around the world, according to the U.S.
Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs. And the threatened DA
account includes money for basic education, now also threatened.

MDG 3-Promote gender equality and empower women: If the House passes
the proposed resolution, "girls and women would bear a heavy burden -
from girls in early childhood programs to women in their working and
childbearing years to women in retirement," wrote Nancy Duff Campbell
in 'The Hill' Wednesday. Experts also point to the linkages between
the goals and the central role girls and women play in their success:
Threats to one often means a threat to the other.

MDG 4-Reduce child mortality: The House's proposed cuts are
"disproportionately made to the most cost- effective humanitarian
programmes saving children's lives," noted Robert Zachritz, U.S.
government relations director for World Vision, in a statement
Tuesday. "8 million children die needlessly every year before the age
of five and can't speak up for themselves," he added. According to
InterAction's calculations, the proposal makes a 15 percent reduction
to the Global Health and Child Survival (GHCS) U.S.A.I.D. account and
10 percent to the GHCS State Department account from enacted FY 2010
funds.

Note: These figures are based on the initial CR proposal.

Impact on Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) 5-8

MDG 5-Improve maternal health: These GHCS accounts also include funds
allocated for maternal health. Reductions include a 32 percent purge
from family planning funds from enacted FY 2010 levels, according to
InterAction. The proposal also makes deep cuts to U.S.A.I.D. and
UNFPA, which provide reproductive health and family planning services
to 50 and 150 countries, respectively, according to Population Action
International.

MDG 6-Combat HIV/AIDS, Malaria, Tuberculosis and other diseases: "The
proposed $450 million cut in contributions to the Global Fund to Fight
AIDS, Malaria and Tuberculosis means that approximately: 10.4 million
bed nets to fight malaria will not be provided; 6 million treatments
for malaria will not be administered; 3.7 million people will not be
tested for HIV; 58,286 HIV-positive, pregnant women will not receive
treatments to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV; 414,000
people will not be provided their antiretroviral (ARV) medication; and
372,000 testing and treatments for tuberculosis will be halted," said
Sheila Nix, U.S. Executive Director of the ONE Campaign, in a
statement Monday.

MDG 7-Ensure environmental sustainability: The DA account, which is
endangered by a 30 percent purge, includes funding for biodiversity
and climate change efforts. Meanwhile, the proposed resolution also
zeroes out contributions to the Clean Technology and Strategic Climate
Funds. While some civil society groups have expressed concerns about
the way these funds are distributed by the multilateral development
banks, eliminating contributions could be "devastating" to U.S.
efforts to tackle global climate change and environmental
sustainability, observers say.

MDG 8-Develop a global partnership for development: If Washington -
one of the world's top donors - won't keep its commitments, it is
argued, countries around the globe might ask, 'why should I?' and 'why
should the U.S. then be allowed at the negotiating table?' With
proposed cuts of 21 percent to international organisations and
programmes, 15 percent to contributions to international peacekeeping,
8 percent to non- United Nations peacekeeping activities, and deep
slashes to multilateral assistance, including a zeroing out of
contributions to the Asian Development Bank, according to
InterAction's figures, observers argue that these reductions threaten
U.S. credibility and partnerships on the world stage.

Note: These figures are based on the initial CR proposal.

OP-ED: Abortion rights are under attack, and pro-choice advocates are
caught in a time warp Date: Friday, February 18, 2011
Source: The Washington Post
Author: Frances Kissling



In the nearly four decades since the Supreme Court ruled that women
have a fundamental right to decide to have an abortion, the opposition
to legal abortion has increased dramatically. Opponents use
increasingly sophisticated arguments - focusing on advances in fetal
medicine, stressing the rights of parents to have a say in their minor
children's health care, linking opposition to abortion with opposition
to war and capital punishment, seeking to make abortion not illegal
but increasingly unavailable - and have succeeded in swinging public
opinion toward their side.

Meanwhile, those of us in the abortion-rights movement have barely
changed our approach. We cling to the arguments that led to victory in
Roe v. Wade. Abortion is a private decision, we say, and the state has
no power over a woman's body. Those arguments may have worked in the
1970s, but today, they are failing us, and focusing on them only risks
all the gains we've made.

The "pro-choice" brand has eroded considerably. As recently as 1995 it
was the preferred label of 56 percent of Americans; that dropped to 42
percent in 2009 and was 45 percent in 2010, according to Gallup polls.
And abortion rights are under attack in Congress. The House passed a
bill on Friday that would strip federal funding from Planned
Parenthood, one of the most important providers of reproductive health
services for poor women. Another proposed House measure would make it
impossible to buy private insurance covering abortion. Anti-choice
Republicans are so secure that Rep. Joe Pitts of Pennsylvania, a
leader of this wing, has introduced an act which will allow hospitals
to deny an abortion even if the pregnant woman's life is at risk.
Meanwhile, 29 governors are solidly anti-abortion, while 15 states
passed 39 laws, most of them restrictive, relating to abortion in 2010
alone.

Pro-choice advocates have good reason to oppose legislation that
restricts abortion in any way, but unfortunately we're not going to
regain the ground we have lost. What we must do is stop holding on to
a strategy that isn't working, and one that is making the legal right
to abortion more vulnerable than ever before.

We can no longer pretend the fetus is invisible. We can no longer seek
to banish the state from our lives, but rather need to engage its
power to improve women's lives. We must end the fiction that an
abortion at 26 weeks is no different from one at six weeks.

These are not compromises or mere strategic concessions, they are a
necessary evolution. The positions we have taken up to now are
inadequate for the questions of the 21st century. We know more than we
knew in 1973, and our positions should reflect that. Related Links:

Source: The Philippine Star
Author: Jun Pasaylo

The House of Representatives approves today the consolidations of the
six versions of the controversial reproductive health (RH) bills.

In a hearing, the House Committee on Rules dubs the new version as
House Bill 4244, otherwise known as ?The Responsible Parenthood,
Reproductive Health and Population Development Act of 2011".

Consolidated into one general bill are measures principally authored
by Representatives Edcel Lagman (HB 96), Janette Garin (HB 101), Kaka
Bag-ao and Walden Bello (HB 513), Rodolfo Biazon (1160), Augusto
Syjuco (HB 1520), Luzviminda Ilagan and Emmi de Jesus (HB 3387).

The measure was scheduled for plenary sponsorship on March 1.

In a statement, Garin said the approval of the consolidated measure
ushered a true exercise of legislative democracy, as ?It gives all of
us an opportunity to listen to all sides?. Related Links:

Women's Rights a Strong Point in Tunisia Date: Tuesday, February 22, 2011
Source: The New York Times
Author: KATRIN BENNHOLD

At the height of the Egyptian uprising, protesters drew encouragement
and practical advice from Tunisian tweets and Facebook messages: ?We
did it, you can do it, too!? read one. Another advised: ?Put vinegar
or onion under your scarf for tear gas.?

Long dismissed in the Arab world as a neutered, pro-Western,
Frenchified country, not to mention small, Tunisia now stands tall,
many of its 10 million people proud that their revolution became an
example for other countries.

But there is another source of Tunisian wisdom that may hold
inspiration for at least half the populations across North Africa and
the Middle East: a long tradition of women?s rights that goes well
beyond anything else in the region.

Women have been more visible than ever before in the discontent
rippling across the Arab world. As unrest spreads to places like Iran,
where women can still be stoned to death for adultery, and Bahrain,
just across the bridge from Saudi Arabia, where they are still not
allowed to drive, let alone vote, the female factor in this new Arab
dawn may yet prove to be one of the most powerful and fundamental ones
in reshaping the region.

Khadija Cherif, secretary general of the International Federation of
Human Rights and a former president of the Tunisian Association of
Democratic Women, puts it this way: ?Arab women have the most to gain
from a new century of Arab enlightenment.?

?We hope that our experience in Tunisia can be an inspiration,? said
Ms. Cherif, who was one of the many women braving police batons and
militias in the monthlong demonstrations that eventually caused the
former president, Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali, to flee to Saudi Arabia on
Jan. 14.

COLUMN: REPRODUCTIVE COERCION Date: Tuesday, February 22, 2011
Source: Philippine Daily Inquirer
Author: Rina Jimenez-David

IT HAS long been a feminist mantra that violence against women,
including partner abuse and rape and sexual aggression, is not about
lust or desire, but more about repression and control.

In a report published in the Feb. 15 (the day after Valentines Day!)
issue of the New York Times, a study found that men who abuse women
physically and emotionally also have a penchant to sabotage their
partners birth control, pressuring them to become pregnant against
their will.

Several small studies have described this kind of coercion among
low-income teenagers and young adults with a history of violence by
intimate partners, writes Times reporter Roni Caryn Rabin. Now a
report by the federally financed National Domestic Violence Hotline
says 1 in 4 women who agreed to answer questions after calling the
hotline said a partner had pressured them to become pregnant, told
them not to use contraceptives, or forced them to have unprotected
sex.

Lisa James, director of health at the Family Violence Prevention Fund
in San Francisco described the findings of the study as very
eye-opening. There were stories about men refusing to wear a condom,
forcing sex without a condom, poking holes in condoms, flushing birth
control pills down the toilet.

There were lots of stories about hiding birth control pillsthat she
kept losing her birth control pills, until she realized that he was
hiding them.

One respondent said she had to hide in the bathroom to take her pill,
while another said that when she got her period recently, her partner
was furious.

The findings are based on the responses of hotline callers to four
questions, although everyone was told she was free to refuse to answer
the questions. Devised by Dr. Elizabeth Miller, an assistant professor
of pediatrics at the School of Medicine at the University of
California, Davis, the questions were part of her ongoing studies on
what she called reproductive coercion.

***

ABOUT one-fourth of the respondents said yes to one or more of these
three questions: Has your partner or ex ever told you not to use any
birth control? Has your partner or ex-partner ever tried to force or
pressure you to become pregnant? Has your partner or ex ever made you
have sex without a condom so that you would get pregnant?

One in six answered yes to the question: Has your partner or
ex-partner ever taken off the condom during sex so that you would get
pregnant?

Its really important to recognize reproductive coercion as another
mechanism for control in an unhealthy relationship, Miller said in an
interview with Rabin. At the same time, she added, younger women and
girls dating older men may be confused by the pressure to become
pregnant.

If you can put yourself in the shoes of a 15-year-old dating an 18- or
19-year-old man, which is not an unusual scenario, and he says to her,
Were going to make beautiful babies together, thats pretty seductive.

But Miller said more research was needed to understand the mens motivations=
.

***

SOME men have an intense desire for a nuclear family, pointed out
Miller, while many who had experiences of a dysfunctional family home
want something better. Others, she added, want to leave a legacy, and
say, Im not sure how long Im going to be around. Gang-affiliated young
men want the status that comes with having babies from multiple women.

The study, says the report, may help explain why young victims of
violence by intimate partners are at an increased risk for unplanned
pregnancies and for sexually transmitted diseases.

This is also the reason eradicating all forms of violence against
women is among the elements of reproductive health, since the link
between partner abuse and unwanted or coerced pregnancy has been clear
long before the study was conducted.

I dont know if any similar study has been conducted in the Philippine
setting, but women share stories of what a hard time they have
negotiating with partners or husbands when they express a desire to
use family planning. Women who undergo a tubal ligation over their
husbands objections report being beaten up when the husband finds out
they went ahead with the procedure anyway. And I have talked to a lot
of women who say they prefer to go for a clandestine (and unsafe)
abortion rather than use contraception because they can conceal the
abortion from their partners, while they must risk a daily
confrontation when they go on the pill or ask their partner to use a
condom.

***

THIS is also the reason women have long agitated for methods of family
planning that put contraception firmly in their hands. Perhaps they
know how unreliableor reluctantsome men can be when it comes to
preventing an unwanted pregnancy.

Its all very well for celibate bishops and priests to insist that
couples engage in natural family planning only, but another thing for
these clerics to be around when the man comes home drunk and horny, or
harbors hidden motives for keeping his partner barefoot and pregnant.
No amount of couple-dialogue can help in this situation. This may also
explain the low rate of condom use in this country, since condoms are
presumably products bought mainly by men, many of whom dont even give
a thought to protection against pregnancy when contemplating sex.

That may explain, too, why male-dominated institutions have such a
hard time acknowledging the right of women to decide freely if they
want to get pregnant and what method they should use to protect
themselves if they dont want to get pregnant at the moment.
Withdrawing that right from women is also a form of reproductive
coercion.

Interview: Time For A New Approach To Abortion Right Date: Tuesday,
February 22, 2011
Source: NPR - Talk of the Nation
Author: Neal Conan

As several state legislatures and the U.S. House of Representatives
are consider measures to restrict access to abortions, Francis
Kissling, former president for Catholics for Choice, says the abortion
rights movement must adjust its tactics to the 21st century.

NEAL CONAN, host:

And now the opinion page. Since the November elections, both state
legislatures and the House of Representatives have considered bills to
limit abortion rights. And yesterday, in a piece in The Washington
Post Outlook section, Frances Kissling argued that the abortion rights
movement needs to adjust its tactics to the 21st century. We can no
longer pretend the fetus is invisible, she wrote. And she added, if
the choice movement does not change, control of policy on abortion
will remain in the hands of those who want it criminalized.

If you support abortion rights, do you think current arguments are
outdated? 800-989-8255. Email: talk@npr.org. You can also join the
conversation on our website and find a link to the op-ed. Go to
npr.org. Click on TALK OF THE NATION.

Frances Kissling is former president of Catholics for Choice, now a
visiting scholar at the Center for Bioethics at the University of
Pennsylvania. And she joins on the line from Mexico City. And nice to
have you with us today.

Ms. FRANCES KISSLING (Visiting Scholar, Center for Bioethics,
University of Pennsylvania): Nice to be with you. Thank you.

CONAN: And essentially, you argue that those who oppose abortion
rights have made considerable ground with tactics that focus on
advances in fetal medicine, while your side continues to cling to the
arguments that prevailed in Roe v. Wade.

Ms. KISSLING: Right. I think the other thing that I would say about
those who are opposed to abortion is that they have also incorporated
into the way they argue about the issue, women. And, you know,
initially, you had - those who are opposed to abortion talked only
about fetuses. And those of us who are in favor about it talked only
about women. And now, while I disagree with a lot of what those who
are opposed to abortion say about women, the fact is that they are
talking about women as well.

I think that, essentially, I think I have the unfortunate proclivity
as an activist to believe that people can hold contradictory things
and complex values at the same time. And so I think that the movement
- that movement which is able to talk both about fetuses and their
value and about women is the side that is going to win over the
majority of the American people. Related Links:

RH bill tests Church's political influence: Miriam Date: Tuesday,
February 22, 2011
Source: ABS-CBNNEWS.com

Sen. Miriam Defensor Santiago on Tuesday said the controversial
Reproductive Health Bill in Congress could prove to be a test case on
how much influence the Catholic Church wields over lawmakers.

In an interview, Santiago said the decision of the Catholic Bishops'
Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) to suspend dialogues with
Malaca=F1ang over the controversial RH Bill only means that the bishops'
group understands the limits of the power of the President to
influence Congress.

"It has seen what the limits of the powers of the president are
because the president of course does not dictate to a co-equal branch
of government. It also indicates that CBCP is very committed against
the RH bill so we shall see whether here religion will be a factor in
the passage of a bill considered urgent for the ultimate development
of the country," she told reporters.

Santiago said one problem with the bill is that involves the
constitutional rights to privacy and a progressive economy.

She said the CBCP's decision will show if the political branches of
government are aware of the potential voting power of the CBCP.

Talks on RH bill suspended as Church digs in on position Date:
Tuesday, February 22, 2011
Source: BusinessWorld
Author: Ana Mae G. Roa

TALKS ON the reproductive health (RH) bill have reached a stalemate
after the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines (CBCP)
temporarily suspended regular dialogues with Malacanang following the
release of a pastoral letter rejecting the measure pending in
Congress.

The Church's decision was contained in a letter sent to President
Benigno S. C. Aquino III by CBCP President and Bishop Nereo P.
Odchimar last Feb. 19, according to a statement posted at the CBCP Web
site.

The two parties have held two dialogues and a third meeting has been
scheduled by the end of the month.

"In view, however, of the pastoral letter that the Catholic Bishops
issued on the matter last Jan. 31, and considering the speed in the
ongoing legislative processes both in the Lower House and the Senate,
I deem it prudent to suspend in the meantime further talks with the
Executive Department," Mr. Odchimar was quoted as saying in the
letter.

The pastoral letter, titled "Choosing Life, Rejecting RH Bill," raised
what it claimed were conflicting opinions between the Church, noting
the "dialogue has simply revealed how far apart our respective
positions are."

The Church leader also said the decision to suspend talks was also due
to the ongoing visitatio ad limina apostolorum of Philippine bishops
with Pope Benedict XVI.

Mr. Odchimar said the next CBCP Permanent Council meeting in the last
week of March may address the issue.

Sought for comment, Presidential Spokesperson Edwin Lacierda said in a
text message to reporters: "While we respect Bishop Nereo P.
Odchimar's decision, it is unfortunate that he chose to suspend the
dialogue with the Executive Department, though no fault on our part,
and notwithstanding the fruitful discussions of the past two
sessions."

"Having said that, however, we have a responsibility to our people and
we will fulfill that mandate consistent with the five-point position
of the President regarding Responsible Parenthood," he added.

Mr. Lacierda was referring to the stand against abortion; protection
of children's welfare; right to uphold religious conviction on family
unity and sacredness of life; right to informed choice; and equal
presentation of natural and artificial family planning methods.

Soldiers jailed over Congo mass rapes Date: Tuesday, February 22, 2011
Source: ABC Premium News (Australia)
Author: Ginny Stein

The most senior Congolese military officer ever to be charged with
mass rape has been sentenced to 20 years in jail.

An open-air military tribunal in eastern Congo found Colonel Kibibi
guilty of ordering the rape, pillage and plunder of the town he was
meant to protect.

Eight of Kibibi's men were also found guilty and sentenced to jail
terms of be-tween 10 and 20 years.

The government has also been ordered to pay compensation to the more
than 50 women who were raped in the attack on New Year's Day, as it
was said to be ultimately responsible for the soldiers' actions.

The crowds began forming early in the morning near the place where the
crimes took place. It was mainly men but women were also scattered
through the crowd, all pressing to hear the verdict.

The New Year's Day rampage shattered the community of Fizi.

In eastern Congo, rape has long been used as a weapon of war.

It was both the fact that the military was so clearly identified and
due to the courage of the women of Fizi in pressing for charges to be
laid that brought this trial together so quickly.

In Congo, assaulting a woman also destroys families.

Of the more than 50 women raped by Colonel Kibibi and his men almost
all of them and their children have been abandoned by their husbands.

In handing down the sentence, military judge Colonel Mkendi found the
men guilty not just of rape but of crimes against humanity.

One soldier was acquitted and another, who is 14, will be tried later
in a juvenile court.

Chief prosecutor Therese Kulungu welcomed the court's decision.

"It is a good decision, a correct decision," she said.

"Everything was done properly so we are morally satisfied and the
victims should also be morally satisfied.

"To see Kibibi condemned for 20 years, it is of great satisfaction to
us. Now, the Congolese state has been found ultimately responsible for
what the soldiers did.

"So the Congolese state must pay the compensation for the victims as
the judge directed."

Kibibi, who was stripped of his rank, said he would appeal.

"My lawyer told me we have to appeal," he said.

"I have five days to lodge my appeal. For me I would like to do it
right here and now but I can't. The judge has handed down his
sentence, but there is no problem, I will appeal."

As Kibibi and his men were led away, the crowd began to jeer.

He rode high on the back of a police pick-up truck, one of his men
raising his fist in the air in salute.

But the crowd called out "You're going to jail, you're a loser Kibibi".

More trials are anticipated in the coming month . With incidents of
rape continuing to rise, it is hoped public shaming and action by the
state will make a difference.

Kline says deception OK in abortion investigations Date: Tuesday,
February 22, 2011
Source: Associated Press
Author: John Hanna

Former Kansas Attorney General Phill Kline testified Monday in an
ethics hearing that he and his subordinates had the right to deceive
other state agencies and didn't have a duty to immediately correct
flawed information provided to a trial judge as they started
investigating abortion providers.

Kline faced more than three hours of questions from an official who
filed an ethics complaint against him, stemming from investigations
Kline pursued as attorney general from 2003 to 2007 and as Johnson
County district attorney from 2007 to 2009.

The three-member panel of the state Board for the Discipline of
Attorneys that opened the hearing Monday will make a recommendation to
the Kansas Supreme Court on what sanctions, if any, Kline should face.
The complaint alleges Kline and subordinates misled other officials
and mishandled patients' medical records in investigating the late Dr.
George Tiller, of Wichita, and a Planned Parenthood clinic in suburban
Kansas City.

Kline, an anti-abortion Republican, vigorously disputes the
allegations, but said he's not surprised to face a complaint because
of past criticism of him by the clinics and other abortion rights
advocates.

Part of his testimony Monday focused on the beginning of his
investigations of the two clinics in 2003, just months after he became
attorney general. Suspecting the clinics weren't reporting cases of
sexual abuse of children to authorities as required by law, his staff
sought information about abuse reports from the state Department of
Social and Rehabilitation Services.

His staff wouldn't fully disclose to SRS why it sought the
information, and the complaint alleges Kline's staff misled SRS
officials.

In testimony, Kline wouldn't concede SRS had been deceived, but added
that he viewed SRS as a potential witness. He said courts regularly
allow law enforcement officials to withhold information from witnesses
and even actively deceive them and suspects to protect an
investigation. Misleading SRS, he said, "would not have been a
problem."

"That is reasonable. That is normal conduct," he testified, his voice
rising. "It was appropriate."

Kline filed misdemeanor charges against Tiller in December 2006,
accusing the doctor of performing illegal late-term abortions and
failing to adequately report the details to the state, as required by
law. The case was dismissed for jurisdictional reasons, and Kline's
successor filed different misdemeanor charges the following year.

Tiller was acquitted in 2009, shortly before being murdered while
attending church.

A criminal case against the Planned Parenthood clinic, filed by Kline
as Johnson County district attorney in 2007, is pending. The clinic
denies the allegations in the 107 charges that it performed illegal
abortions and falsified records.

Kline lost his bid for re-election as attorney general in 2006;
Republicans selected him to fill a vacancy in the Johnson County job,
but he lost the 2008 GOP primary for the post. He's now an assisting
visiting professor of law at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Va.,
founded by evangelist Jerry Falwell.

The state Supreme Court which already has criticized Kline in opinions
in abortion cases could impose no sanction, or a punishment ranging
from an informal admonishment to the loss of his license to practice
in state courts. But Kline's license was suspended in October after he
didn't pay a $50 annual fee.

"I don't believe I should be here, and I didn't want to pay you
money," Kline told state Disciplinary Administrator Stanton Hazlett
during his testimony.

The complaint notes under Kline, the attorney general's office
successfully sought in October 2003 to open a court-supervised
"inquisition" into the clinics, based partly on data from SRS. The
inquisition allowed Kline to seek subpoenas for documents or
testimony.

Nine days later, an internal memo showed Kline's staff knew the SRS
data was flawed, but his office didn't inform the judge until May
2004, nearly seven months later.

"Shouldn't you immediately inform the judge?" Hazlett asked.

Kline replied: "I don't know if that duty exists."

Kline noted his office told the judge the next time it sought a
subpoena, arguing it fulfilled the requirement to make a correction.
He noted that when Tiller's attorneys raised the same issue in trying
to block the doctor's prosecution, the judge ruled the criminal case
still should go forward.

"We just have a difference of opinion about the duties of a
prosecutor," Kline told Hazlett.

Kline said his complaint "parroted" arguments made by Tiller attorney
Dan Monnat in 2008 in an unsuccessful attempt at getting the criminal
case against Tiller dismissed.

And in his opening statement, Kline attorney Reid Holbrook even guided
the panel through similar passages in both. Later, Hazlett said his
complaint contained numerous allegations not included in Monnat's
work.

Kline testifies that his tactics were sound Date: Tuesday, February 22, 201=
1
Source: The Wichita Eagle (Kansas)
Author: David Klepper

Phill Kline defiantly insisted that his tactics were sound and his
cause just during his efforts to bring charges against Planned
Parenthood and Wichita abortion provider George Tiller.

Kline took the stand Monday to face allegations that he misled and
defied judges, mishandled evidence and said too much to Bill O'Reilly
throughout his long investigation of Kansas abortion clinics.

"These charges were supported, and these charges need to be tried,"
said Kline, a former Republican attorney general and Johnson County
district attorney.

Stanton Hazlett, the state's judicial disciplinary administrator,
argues that Kline broke ethical rules for attorneys as he investigated
the abortion provid-ers.

A three-attorney panel sits in judgment. If the panel finds Kline in
violation of ethical rules, it would be up to the Kansas Supreme Court
to decide any discipline. Punishment could range from censure to
disbarment.

Kline's Kansas license is inactive; he now teaches law at Liberty
University in Virginia. But disbarment could make it difficult for
Kline to practice law in another state.

The contentious politics of abortion permeated much of Kline's
testimony. Hazlett asked him at one point whether he would support
banning abortions at any time during a woman's pregnancy.

"I believe a wise decision for this nation would be to end abortion,
yes," Kline said.

Hazlett questioned Kline about a 2006 appearance on O'Reilly's show
after showing clips of the episode. Kline, who was days away from
losing his re-election bid for attorney general, spoke to O'Reilly
about his investigation of Tiller despite having been warned by the
Supreme Court to avoid such publicity.

O'Reilly referred to Tiller as a "killer" and said he had "evidence"
that Tiller was performing illegal abortions and covering for
pedophiles that impregnate girls.

"Would you agree that for some people ... that could be inflammatory,
could it not?" Hazlett asked Kline.

"The whole topic is inflammatory for whole groups of people," Kline respond=
ed.

Accused of giving a state agency misleading information when seeking
reports on sexual abuse, Kline said his staff was under no obligation
to explain their motives to a source of information. Even, he said, in
the case of another state agency that the attorney general's office
represented in court.

When Hazlett asked him about that last point, Kline shot back: "Are
you claiming a conflict? You know better than that."

The agency in question was then under the administration of former
Gov. Kathleen Sebelius, a Democrat. Kline said he worried the agency
might not provide the reports he wanted if it knew his true motives.

"The concern was that the Sebelius administration would not be
forthright in the investigation," he said. "The administration had an
adverse position to this type of investigation."

The ethical allegations against Kline include charges that he:

* Told the Supreme Court that his investigation wasn't seeking
identities of specific women who received abortions. But in 2005,
investigators allege, Kline's staff recorded the license plates of
visitors to Tiller's clinic on East Kellogg and subpoenaed guests'
names from an east Wichita hotel often used by his patients.

* Mishandled redacted medical files by storing them in an open garage,
a private vehicle and the dining room of an investigator. Kline took
some copies of the Tiller records with him when he became district
attorney.

* Selectively presented information to a Johnson County grand jury
investigating Planned Parenthood.

* Relied on data that Kline's staff knew to be flawed to justify the
investigation before a judge.

Kline's investigation of Planned Parenthood and Tiller began shortly
after he became attorney general in 2003 and continued when he became
Johnson County district attorney in 2007. Kline accused the abortion
providers of violating state law and covering for pedophiles by not
reporting pregnancies of underage girls. He sought medical records of
former patients to prove his case.

Before leaving office as district attorney, Kline filed 107 charges
against Planned Parenthood. After a long delay, that case is now
moving forward under current Johnson County District Attorney Steve
Howe.

Kline's testimony will continue today, when it's likely his attorney
will get to question him. In his defense, Kline points to an internal
report by Hazlett's own investigators that seemed to clear Kline of
wrongdoing. The 2008 report was prepared by a Topeka attorney tasked
by the disciplinary administrator with reviewing the evidence against
Kline.

"After reviewing the substantial documentation in this case, it is the
opinion of these investigators that there is not probable cause to
prove that Phill Kline violated any of the rules of ethics," the
report concluded.

The first witness was Veronica Dersch, a former prosecutor in the
office of Kline's successor as attorney general, Paul Morrison. Dersch
was charged with continuing Kline's investigation after he left
office. Early on she found copies of e-mails between Kline staff
members that showed they knew about flaws in the reports Kline used to
justify his investigation before a judge.

"They had given the judge a basis to get the inquisition opened and
that basis was not right," she testified. "It just seemed shady."

Nurse: More middle-class patients accessing system Date: Monday,
February 21, 2011
Source: Modesto Bee
Author: Jocelyn Wiener

Alice DeLaurie-O'Neil has worked as a nurse at Planned Parenthood for
the past year and a half. Increasingly, she and others at the clinic
on McHenry Avenue in Modesto see middle-class patients in their 40s
and 50s coming into the clinic for the first time -- with no
insurance.

Some of these women say haven't had a pap smear for years. Some say
they've felt a breast lump for the past two years, but didn't have the
money to get it checked.

"It just tears your heart apart," DeLaurie-O'Neil said.

Older patients often assume Planned Parenthood is all about condoms
and birth control pills, and feel embarrassed to be seen there, she
said.

But, as the economy continues to stagnate, and so many have lost jobs
and insurance, they're beginning to get past that stigma. The total
number of visits to the clinic has increased from less than 12,000 in
2006 to almost 18,000 last year.

DeLaurie-O'Neil, 58, has worked in nursing on and off since 1975. Last
year, she came to Planned Parenthood out of retirement because she,
herself, needed health insurance.

The recent shift in need has been noticeable, she said. She's long
seen poor people and low-income workers struggle to access health
care. But now the center staff is seeing professional women, bank
tellers and teachers who've lost jobs or had their hours cut, or who
are trying to cut corners after their husbands become unemployed.

One of DeLaurie-O'Neil's colleagues, a nurse who used to work in
private practice, said she's seen about 20 of her former private
practice patients coming into the clinic in the past 18 months.

A recent survey conducted by Planned Parenthood Mar Monte -- which
serves 42 counties across Central California and Northern Nevada --
shows that more than 45 percent of patients had lost jobs or hours in
the past year, and almost 53 percent had avoided seeing a doctor in
the past year due to cost.

The Modesto center's staff can provide limited types of care, but for
many health conditions they must do their best to find other resources
for their patients, calling upon doctor friends or other safety net
providers for help.

Sometimes, the best thing DeLaurie-O'Neil can do is let patients tell
her their stories.

"Sometimes just somebody listening to you is all you need to get
through the day," she said.

EDITORIAL: Abortion Oversight; Corbett Cracks Down On The State's
Failure To Inspect Date: Saturday, February 19, 2011
Source: Pittsburgh Post-Gazette

After a grand jury report detailed the horror that occurred for years
at an unregulated Philadelphia abortion clinic, Pennsylvanians were
shocked and demanded accountability of those who allowed it to
operate.

Gov. Tom Corbett now has brought accountability, at least to the
public employees he believes were the enablers. Separately, 10 clinic
staff members face criminal charges, including four charged with
murder.

The clinic hadn't been inspected since 1993, yet numerous warnings
were ignored. The grand jury blamed failures at the Pennsylvania
Department of Health as well as a board operating under the Department
of State.

Mr. Corbett first ordered his nominees for secretary of health, Dr.
Eli Avila, and secretary of state, Carole Aichele, to review the grand
jury's rec-ommendations and devise a plan to change the system. He
then went after those deemed responsible. Seven state employees either
have resigned or been termi-nated. Four others named in the grand jury
investigation had previously left their jobs.

The case called for strong action and the governor delivered -- so
there is no cause for complaint, assuming that the culpability of
terminated individuals was fairly judged. The same assumption of good
faith is required for the specific changes Mr. Corbett is requiring
state regulators to make.

At first blush, the rules seem fair -- four apply to the Department of
State, 11 to the Department of Health and three more for both
departments jointly. Among the demands, all facilities will be
inspected annually. Additional random inspections will be done
unannounced, including weekends and evenings. A facility that fails to
report a serious event -- one in which a patient receives some level
of harm -- will be fined up to $1,000 a day until a report is made.
Clinics must prominently display a poster with a 24-hour toll-free
number to take complaints.

Given the seriousness of the Philadelphia scandal, none of this
appears excessive. Indeed, Kim Evert, the head of Planned Parenthood
of Western Pennsylvania, said her organization is not against
inspections, believing they are a reasonable response.

But the test of the stricter regulation will be all in the doing. The
administration seems to be making a sincere effort to protect the
health and safety of women who are undergoing a medical procedure. As
long as this does not become intimidation by bureaucracy to limit the
exercise of a legal right, it is a good response.

Dust off the IUDs; Doctors are seeing renewed interest in old form of
birth control Date: Friday, February 18, 2011
Source: The Toronto Star

The IUD, the most effective form of reversible birth control, is
making a comeback after decades gathering dust on pharmacy shelves.

Although the pill, used by almost a third of sexually active women, is
still most popular, doctors are reporting more and more requests for
intrauterine devices (IUDs), small, flexible, T-shaped frames inserted
into the uterus by a doctor.

"We are putting them in more women, and in more younger women," says
Dr. Dara Maker, co-medical director at the Bay Centre for Birth
Control and a family doctor at Women's College Hospital.

A 2009 study led by Dr. Sheila Dunn, research and program director for
the Bay Centre for Birth Control, found IUD insertion rates in Ontario
have been on the rise since 2001, particularly among women aged 25 to
39.

Still, only between 1 and 3 per cent of Canadian women choose the IUD,
while in Europe, as many as 25 per cent rely on them to prevent
pregnancy. Some doctors blame that gap on concerns about the IUD's
safety and efficacy after the Dalkon Shield scandal of the 1970s.

The Dalkon Shield was an IUD model whose faulty design led to a
disproportionate number of cases of pelvic inflammatory disease,
ectopic pregnancies, and even death. The model's tailstrings, which
hung down into the vagina, were made of multiple strands wound
together that allowed bacteria to "wick" up into the uterus. Lawsuits
were filed against its manufacturer and it was eventually pulled off
the market.

The new models available in Canada are not associated with those
problems, because the strings are made of a single strand. There are
two kinds of IUDs on the Canadian market, both of which are inserted
into the uterus for up to five years: copper models called the Flexi-T
and the Nova-T, and a hormone-releasing model called the Mirena.

Copper IUDs, in which a smooth wire is wound around the plastic frame,
work by altering the chemistry of the womb, making it a toxic
environment for sperm, though doctors still aren't sure of the exact
mechanism.

The plastic frame of the Mirena contains a barrel of slow-release
levonorgestrel, which prevents pregnancy in multiple ways, primarily
by increasing the amount of mucus in the cervix, which blocks sperm,
and lessening the thickness of the uterine lining, making it difficult
for a fertilized egg to become implanted. They can be removed at any
point with no impact on fertility.

The devices are so effective that the failure rate (around 1 per cent
for copper IUDs and less than 1 per cent for the Mirena) is comparable
to tubal ligation (between 1 and 2.5 per cent). Unlike the pill, "the
beauty of the IUD is that it doesn't depend on the user," says Dunn of
the Bay Centre for Birth Control.

Yet "there's not as much awareness about the IUD as there could be,
particularly among younger women," says Dr. Erica Weir, associate
medical officer of health for York Region.

That could be because, as research suggests, misinformation is
widespread among doctors. One 2008 study of Kingston, Ont., family
physicians' perceptions about IUDs found a huge gap between doctors'
beliefs and the current clinical guidelines.

More than two-thirds of the 96 respondents said they would not
recommend IUDs to women who had not given birth, despite well-accepted
guidelines from the World Health Organization and the Canadian
Contraception Consensus that put very few restrictions on their use.

Even though IUDs are 99 per cent effective or better, between 38 and
47 per cent of respondents believed failure was a "major" risk.

More than 60 per cent thought pelvic inflammatory disease was a "major
risk" with the current IUD models, though the infection risk increases
only slightly for the first month after insertion and afterwards is
the same as that of the general population.

"The results were quite striking," says Dr. Esther Stubbs, a study
author who has had a family practice in Belleville for the past four
years. "I was quite surprised at how big the misperceptions were."

Doctors who had been practising for 20 years or longer were less
likely to prescribe IUDs than younger doctors, the study showed.
International research also shows that urban doctors are more likely
to prescribe IUDs to young, childless women than rural doctors. Stubbs
expects the situation in Kingston would be much the same in most
Canadian urban centres.

"Some of the myths have been dispelled," says Maker. "It just takes a
long time to filter through to the general population, and even the
medical field."

COLUMN: Pregnancy prevention bill is needed but faces uncertain future
Date: Sunday, February 20, 2011
Source: Tulsa World
Author: Janet Pearson

An enlightened and reasonable measure that could go far in addressing
Oklahoma's chronic teen pregnancy problem - and many of the other
problems teens face growing up - is before the state Legislature.

At this point, the legislation's future is uncertain, which is
unfortunate, because Oklahoma's young people need help on these fronts
more than ever before.

Two bills - House Bill 1195 by Rep. Jeannie McDaniel, D-Tulsa, and
Senate Bill 535, by Sen. Connie Johnson, D-Oklahoma City - would
require local school boards to develop courses in human growth and
development that include instruction on "human sexuality, self-esteem,
stress management, interpersonal relationships, domestic abuse,
sexually transmitted disease" and HIV/AIDS.

The course materials would have to be "age-appropriate and medically
accurate," and instruction would be provided from grades six through
12.

House passes Pence plan to block funds to Planned Parenthood Date:
Friday, February 18, 2011
Source: Gannett
Author: Maureen Groppe

The Republican-led House on Friday backed a years-long effort by Rep.
Mike Pence to cut off federal funding to Planned Parenthood.

The House voted 240-185 for a Pence amendment that would prevent
Planned Parenthood from getting federal money, including grants under
the Title X program, which offers family planning and related
preventive health services. The program is aimed at low-income
families.

"I think it comes as a surprise to most Hoosiers and to most Americans
that the largest abortion provider in the country is the largest
recipient of federal funding under Title X," said Pence, R-Columbus.
"We can stop that."

The amendment was to a bill that would fund the government through the
remaining seven months of the fiscal year. Because Congress did not
complete work on the budget last year, the government has been
operating under a stop-gap measure that ends March 4.

In addition to Pence's amendment aimed at any federal funding for
Planned Parenthood, the underlying bill would cut all Title X funding
for any recipient.

President Barack Obama has threatened to veto the bill over cuts that
he said would "sharply undermine core government functions and
investments key to economic growth and job creation."

Senate Democrats also oppose the bill's $61 billion in proposed
spending cuts across the entire government.

Opponents to Pence's amendment and to the overall cuts to Title X
funding voiced confidence that those provisions would not be included
in the final version of the bill, which must get the approval of both
the Senate and the president.

"In the Senate, cooler heads tend to prevail," said Cecile Richards,
president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America.

Planned Parenthood receives about a quarter of the $317 million Title X bud=
get.

The health care provider receives about $363 million in all government
grants and contracts, including through services reimbursed by
Medicaid, the joint federal-state health care program for the poor.
Government funding represents about one-third of Planned Parenthood's
budget.

A state House committee voted Thursday to prevent Planned Parenthood
from receiving Medicaid funding in Indiana.

Not all Planned Parenthood clinics offer abortion, and the law forbids
federal funding from being used to pay for most abortion services. But
Pence contends that the federal funding Planned Parenthood gets for
other services frees up funding to cover abortions.

"All Planned Parenthood has to do is say they're going to stop
performing abortions," said GOP Rep. John Culberson of Texas. "And yet
they won't do it."

Democratic lawmakers accused Republicans of waging a war on women.

"This is part of a Republican agenda to force women back into
traditional roles with limited opportunities," said Democratic Rep.
Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut.

Rep. Lois Capps, D-California, said Pence must not know that Planned
Parenthood provides exams, contraceptives and cancer screenings to
18,000 women in Indiana.

"I'd like to ask him how he plans to replace the services," Capps
said. "My guess is that he has no plan and no answer."

Pence, who is considering running for governor in 2012, has for years
introduced legislation to block Planned Parenthood from receiving
Title X funding and to block family planning dollars from any
recipient that provides abortions.

"As women voters in Indiana learn that one of Rep. Mike Pence's top
legislative priorities is effectively denying access to preventive
care for millions of women, he will have difficulty winning their vote
as he considers running for governor," Richards said. "Americans want
their elected leaders focusing on fixing the economy and creating
jobs, not pushing an extreme ideological agenda that would take away
health care for women."

Arizona House OKs bill to ban selection abortions Date: Tuesday,
February 22, 2011
Source: Associated Press
Author: Paul Davenport

The Arizona House approved a bill on Monday to prohibit abortions
sought because of the race or sex of the fetus or the race of a
parent.

The measure sent to the Senate on a 41-18 vote would allow suits and
civil fines against abortion providers who knowingly provide abortions
for selection of race or sex.

"That kind of discrimination is unconscionable," said Rep. Steve
Montenegro, a Litchfield Park Republican who said he introduced the
bill "to take a stand against bigotry and prejudice."

Montenegro and opponents disagreed over whether there's evidence that
abortions to select race and sex occur in Arizona.

"It appears to be a measure that is in search of a problem," said Rep.
Matt Heinz, D-Tucson. "It's not even clear to me how providers can be
accused of doing this."

Other opponents suggested that the bill was intended to place
obstacles in the path of minorities and abortion providers.

The House's vote on the bill mostly tracked party lines.

Democrats Albert Hale of Window Rock, Macario Saldate of Tucson and
Catherine Miranda of Phoenix joined most Republicans in voting for the
bill, and Republicans Russ Jones of Yuma and Kate Brophy McGee of
Phoenix joined most Democrats in voting against it.

The House on Monday postponed consideration of another abortion bill,
one that would place new restrictions on clinics that perform
medication abortions.

Planned Parenthood Arizona has said that bill would force it to drop
medication abortions in its clinics outside the Phoenix and Tucson
areas.

The clinic regulation bill's sponsor, Republican Kimberly Yee of
Phoenix, said she sought the postponement to give her time to prepare
an amendment.

HIV Patients Go Missing Before Treatment Date: Friday, February 18, 2011
Source: IRIN ? Plus News

a serious gap in HIV care and prevention, say researchers.

Most patients in South Africa must have a CD4 count - a measure of the
immune system's strength - of 200 or less to be eligible for
antiretrovirals (ARVs), but previous research has shown that about
two-thirds of people will not meet ARV treatment criteria at
diagnosis.

Published in the 1 March edition of the journal AIDS, the study
examined about a year's worth of CD4 laboratory records for 4,223 HIV
patients in South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal province who were not
eligible for ARVs. Conducted by the Africa Centre for Health and
Population Studies at South Africa's University of KwaZulu-Natal, the
research found high loss-to-follow-up rates and that patients
diagnosed HIV-positive at higher CD4 counts, and who were younger and
male, were more likely not to return for CD4 count tests at the
recommended six month intervals.

The study also noted that among patients who remained in clinic's
outpatient care, the majority returned only once for CD4 monitoring
and that their CD4 counts dropped much more quickly than previous
South African research has suggested. CD4 level counts dropped by an
average of about nine cells per month. However, patients with higher
CD4 counts, who were also less likely to adhere to CD4 monitoring, saw
drops as much as twice that.

While the study did not include qualitative data on patients' reasons
for discontinuing care, lead author Richard Lessells said the limited
medical services available to pre-ARV patients may be partly to blame.

While patients like these can access drugs such as bactrim and
co-trimoxazole for opportunistic infections, Lessells said that if
patients are sick enough for these drugs, they are usually sick enough
to qualify for ARVs.

"As a doctor the most frustrating thing is seeing a patient return
with opportunistic infections and finding out that they were diagnosed
two years previously with a CD4 count of 300 but had been lost to the
system. Now they are presenting sick and require hospital care," he
told IRIN/PlusNews. "It's frustrating to know that, in theory, this is
preventable."

For Lessells, the study highlights a patient population that has been
sidelined in the rush to get those who are eligible on ARVs.

"These patients certainly aren't the priority," he told IRIN/PlusNews.
"The clinics are already overcapacity just dealing with patients ARVs
so there's very little scope or time even for people who are not in
that category."

With priorities elsewhere, he added that most programmes and the South
African Department of Health do not collect data on pre-ARV patients
or their access to care, but that these patients represent a key entry
point for initiatives looking to reduce AIDS-related mortality and new
HIV infections.

With an estimated HIV prevalence of about 18 percent, South Africa
currently runs the world's largest ARV programme with more than one
million patients on treatment. In an effort to get more patients on
treatment earlier and bolster behavior change, the government is in
the midst of a national campaign to voluntarily test 15 million South
Africans for HIV by April 2011.

But Lessells cautioned that the high loss-to-follow up of pre-ARV
patients jeopardizes these goals.

"The whole point of this testing campaign is to try and get as many
people to know their status as possible, based on the assumption that
people will change their behaviour, but we need to make sure that
there are programmes supporting people, and giving them appropriate
care and education about prevention," he said. "There's a lot of
literature out there about the integration of HIV care and prevention,
but at a practical level, this isn't happening."

While a smaller, Johannesburg-based study published last year in the
journal of Tropical Medicine and International Health confirmed high
pre-ARV loss-to-follow-up, Lessells said more research was needed into
this group, including what programmes could provide in terms of
incentives.

And figuring out what keeps pre-ARV patients away, may mean rethinking
programmes.

"[Researchers, programme managers] are always looking at what it is
about the patients that makes them not come back; there's always this
sense that the patient is to blame," he told IRIN/PlusNews. "We need
to get over that and start thinking what it is about our programmes
that are not encouraging people to stay."

While many studies have shown that the farther patients must travel to
a clinic, the less likely they are to return, Lessells' study found
that retention was low despite the fact that about 90 percent of the
study population lived within 5km of the nearest clinic.

As government continues to push for the roll-out of isoniazid
preventative (IPT) tuberculosis therapy among all HIV patients,
Lessells said he hoped research was being undertaken to ascertain
whether the addition of this service would provide the kind of
incentive needed to retain patients or whether the added stress on
clinics and pharmacies would become yet another disincentive to
staying in care.

EDITORIAL: 'Trafficking' bill needs clarity Date: Monday, February 21, 2011
Source: The Honolulu Star-Advertiser

Last year's Legislature approved a bill aimed at setting penalties for
sex trafficking only to see it vetoed by then-Gov. Linda Lingle after
prosecutors and public defenders complained that it overlapped
existing laws, causing confusion. This year's legislation, though well
intentioned, is similarly flawed, so changes are needed to gain the
support of law-enforcement leadership.

Proponents of the legislation point out that Hawaii is one of five
states that have yet to enact laws specifically against human
trafficking. They argue that the omission be ended by passing two
bills, one dealing with labor trafficking and the other with sex
trafficking. Both have received preliminary approval by legislative
committees but without endorsement by law enforcement agencies.

Federal authorities brought charges last September in a case involving
Thai workers who allegedly were exploited by being forced to work on
more than a dozen farms on Oahu, Maui and the Big Island. One of the
bills before the Legislature would criminalize labor trafficking under
state law for the first time.

Sex trafficking is attracting more attention. FBI officials told
legislators last year that Honolulu ranks among the nation's major
destination cities for people wanting to solicit child prostitution.
An informational briefing this month organized by Rep. John Mizuno,
chairman of the House Human Services Committee, elicited emotional
accounts, including that of a Hono-lulu teenager who told of being
forced into prostitution for three months until she escaped.

A bill would create a statute entitled "Sex Trafficking" that would
make sex trafficking of a person younger than 18 a Class A felony,
except that such a law was enacted three years ago, without using the
term "sex trafficking." Sex trafficking of those 18 or older would be
a Class B felony, but state Attorney General David M. Louie points out
that such a law already is on the books without the term of
"trafficking."

In fact, Louie added, "confusing words" in the bill "would make it
more difficult to obtain convictions than under current laws that
prohibit the same conduct." Honolulu Prosecutor Keith Kaneshiro said
at the Mizuno briefing that upgrading penalties for current laws
"would be more effective," but the Pacific Alliance to Stop Slavery
insists that existing laws are ineffective.

Lingle vetoed last year's bill because it did not "clearly define the
prohibited conduct in a way that can be enforced and prosecuted in
court." Her attorney general, Mark Bennett, then-city Prosecutor Peter
Carlisle and the Honolulu Police Department opposed the bill.

Little if anything has changed, and proponents of the bill titled "Sex
Trafficking" have yet to make the case that changes are needed and
would, in fact, be an improvement. Such concerns need to be addressed
and reconciled before the legislation advances

COLUMN: Save Planned Parenthood from federal budget axe Date: Tuesday,
February 22, 2011
Source: The Salt Lake Tribune (Utah)
Author: Peg McEntee

Way back in my college days, I and every young woman I knew relied on
Planned Parenthood for health screenings, preventive medicine and,
yes, birth control. It was the only solution for those of us who paid
tuition, worked part-time jobs for peanuts and no insurance, and
couldn't afford anything else.

Last year, 51,000 men and women went to Planned Parenthood's Utah
clinics for contraception, testing for sexually transmitted diseases
and HIV, cancer screenings, vasectomies and preventive medicine.

Now, in its wisdom, the U.S. House has voted to strip all funding for
Title X, the national family planning program that over the years has
helped millions of Americans, most low-income, to plan their families
so they can properly care for them.

Naturally, Utah Reps. Rob Bishop and Jason Chaffetz voted with the
majority to save $327 million, the full federal contribution to family
planning nationwide. To his credit, Rep. Jim Matheson stood with most
other Democrats and voted no.

However, under an amendment offered by Rep. Mike Pence of Indiana,
Planned Parenthood in particular would not receive federal money,
including Medicaid or even help from the national Centers for Disease
Control.

All that to punish not only the organization, but "to punish every man
and woman who relies on our care," says Karrie Galloway, director of
Planned Parenthood of Utah.

Which, since last fall, has broken a long-standing policy and began
offering early-term abortions (legal in the U.S. since 1973) to help
meet demand in a time of a dwindling number of providers. To date,
fewer than 100 procedures have been performed, Galloway says.

Still, Planned Parenthood's main emphasis is not just on birth
control, but STD prevention and treatment to ensure that men and women
can protect their fertility and the health of all our children.

It also uses its Title X funding wisely. Every dollar spent on family
planning saves $4 in Medicaid and other social service costs, Galloway
says. Its health centers and contract locations serve not only the
metro areas, but Utah's sparsely populated areas.

"We stretch a dollar pretty thin," she says.

I understand how many people can't bear the thought of abortion, and
they have the right to their convictions. What I don't understand is
why anyone would want to eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood,
which focuses on contraception and reproductive health for those who
couldn't otherwise afford it.

It's telling that in Utah, 97 percent of those served are uninsured,
and 85 percent of the services provided are paid for with Title X
money.

That's not money down the drain, or some insidious scheme to abolish
moral tenets. Back in college, it was a way for young women and men to
safely express their sexuality without risking disease or, at worst, a
lifetime of regret. It still is.

BLOG: Senate Dems present united front on GOP abortion fight Date:
Monday, February 21, 2011
Source: The Hill
Author: Jason Millman

A handful of Senate Democrats are presenting a united front against
new reproductive-rights restrictions being pushed by House
Republicans.

The House on Friday, during its debate of a spending bill to keep the
government running past March 4, approved an amendment by Rep. Mike
Pence (R-Ind.) stripping federal funding from Planned Parenthood,
which receives about $350 million each year in federal, state and
local grants.

The newly empowered House Republicans are pushing ahead with a slate
of anti-abortion legislation, and a few Senate Democrats have been
fighting back hard for weeks.

Democratic Sens. Barbara Boxer (Calif.), Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.),
Richard Blumenthal (Conn.), Al Franken (Minn.) and Jeanne Shaheen
(N.H.) have promised recently to block the Republican agenda to limit
abortion services and defund Planned Parenthood.

Asked by reporters Thursday if the Senate had the votes to defeat
Pence?s battle against Planned Parenthood, Franken offered a one-word
answer: ?Yes."

Following the recess week, the Senate will produce a spending bill
that will look much different from the House version, which blocks
funding to implement the healthcare reform law. With the prospect of a
government shutdown looming over the continuing resolution, it?s
unclear if Republicans will back down on defunding Planned Parenthood.

Republicans have made two other abortion bills a top priority. Reps.
Joe Pitts (R-Pa.) and Daniel Lipinski (D-Ill.) introduced a bill that
would bar the healthcare reform law from funding abortions and expand
?conscience protections? to healthcare workers and entities that
object to abortion care on religious or moral grounds. Another bill
from Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.) would set wider abortion restrictions,
including a ban on tax breaks for private health plans that cover
abortion.

Democrats are accusing Republicans of abandoning an election mandate
to focus on jobs and the economy.

Bangladeshi's Rural Sector May Collapse Within Decades: Analysts Date:
Monday, February 21, 2011
Source: Asia Pulse

Bangladesh will face a severe food crisis within a couple of decades
due to over exploitation and rapid decline of cultivable land due to
excessive population and climate change, experts say.

Analsyts believe that the population is increasing very fast in the
country, but that agricultural land has been declining from gradually
keeping pace with rapid growth of the population, which ultimately
will force the country into a severe food crisis within a couple of
decades.

Currently, there are 164.4 million people in the country. The present
population growth rate is 1.4 per cent. The country's projected
population is 222.5 million by 2050, said a UNFPA report recently.

Agriculture expert Prof. B.K. Bala says that the country will have to
address the food demand of rapidly growing population in the short run
(for the next 20 years) by adapting multiple crop system in
agriculture as it has no other alternative to increase food
production.

He said: "Now, we are cultivating the High Yielding Varieties (HYV) of
crops to produce more food grains, which increased the food production
in the country. But it will never be the final solution to address the
country's food demand considering the rapid growth of population."

Prof. Bala, a teacher of the Department of Farm Power and Machinery at
Bangladesh Agricultural University, said the price of food grains has
reached a record level in the global market, which also affects the
local market. The food price in the country is increasing gradually,
which is a sign of emerging food crisis.

"We wont be able to address the food demand in future by cultivating
HYV crops. If we cant minimize our population, we cant survive. The
countrys agriculture cannot survive in future as a whole."

About the rapid decline of cultivable land, he said that according to
Bangladesh Bureau of Statistic (BBS), there was around 21 million
acres of net-crop cultivable land in the country in 1980, and after
gradually declining, it stood at 18 million acres in 2007.

"About three million acres of agricultural lands have gone to other
sectors including housing, infrastructure and industrial sector over
the last three decades," Bala added.

FAO national consultant, Shahidul Islam, said agricultural land is
declining due to unplanned urbanization, which emerged due to
excessive population and this is contributing to a tremendous impact
on crop production in the country.

He said the country's agricultural sector had survived over 30 years
with old infrastructure of 1980. Now, its survival capacity is
decreasing. Agricultural production capacity is also declining, but
population is increasing fast. As people are exploiting the land, its
fertility is falling gradually.

Islam said it is known that cultivable land is declining by one per
cent each year, but the rate may be higher as no proper statistics is
available in this regard.

He predicted that the country will face a food crisis in coming years
as the food grains production has been decreasing not only in the
country but all over the globe due to climate change.

"Wheat production has declined in Russia, Canada and Australia due to
drought in recent years and this trend will continue. We wont be able
to procure food grains from international market to meet country's
demand," he said.

According to a recent study, around 2666,856 acres of agricultural
land had gone to other sectors including housing and construction over
the last four decades.

The study revealed that the country is losing about 72,077 acres of
cultivable land each year, at 197 acres per day.

Economists Prof. Abul Barakat, Gazi Mohammad Suhrawardy and Partha
Sarathee Ghosh jointly carried out the study titled -
Commercialization of Agricultural Land and Waterbodies and
Disempowerment of Poor in Bangladesh: An exploratory Study.

The study shows that the average of around 64,489 acres of cultivable
land has gone to the housing sector per year over the last four
decades, with 6,262 acres for constructing shopping malls, about 222
acres for the industrial sector, 2,827 acres for building educational
institutions and 1,996 acres in constructing mosques.

It found that about 44,255 farmers have left agriculture farming per
year over the last four decades. Around 154,777 fishermen have been
forced to change their ancestral occupation per year over the last two
decades.

However, Palli Karma Sahayak Foundation (PKSP) chairman and eminent
economist Dr Kazi Kholiquzzaman on Thursday at a seminar emphasized on
taking steps to minimize country's population to save the agriculture
sector as well as ensure food security in the country.

Terming population boom as the number one problem in the country, he
said: "Agricultural land and production are declining. But country's
population is increasing very fast."

Dr Kholiquzzaman observed that the ongoing climate change is also a
great threat to agriculture. The agricultural production has already
declined in the country due to drought, flash flood, storm surge,
cyclone and erratic rainfall.

He said if the sea level will rise one meter, around 20-25 per cent of
agricultural land in the coastal belt will go under the sea water by
next 30-40 years.

BLOG: This is what 'pro-life' looks like? Date: Friday, February 18, 2011
Source: Salon
Author: Rebecca Traister

As part of their stated mission to focus on jobs (specifically, the
job of preventing women from getting healthcare), House Republicans
this afternoon voted 240-185 to bar federal funding for Planned
Parenthood.

This is a big win for Rep. Mike Pence, the Indiana Republican whose
deficit-minded crusade against Planned Parenthood hinges not on the
argument that taxpayer money shouldn't pay for abortions (the Hyde
Amendment put a stop to that in the mid 1970s), but on the conviction
that taxpayer money should not go to organizations that provide
abortion services, regardless of what else they might do.

Pence's plan, which will likely stall in the Senate, would mean the
end of federal support for an organization that each year provides
more than 800,000 women with breast exams, more than 4 million
Americans with testing and treatment for sexually transmitted
diseases, and 2.5 million people with contraception, which, not for
nothing, is the stuff that prevents unintended pregnancy, and thus
abortion, to begin with.

In Friday?s Washington Post, former Catholics for a Free Choice
president Frances Kissling suggested that the current, harrowing
onslaught against reproductive rights should force the pro-choice
movement to alter its path and redirect what has indeed become a
slightly stale message.

Though I'm not sure I see eye-to-eye with Kissling on which particular
path to take, I agree that now is the time for women and men who
believe in women?s rights, health and liberty to reclaim the language
of morality and life, long coopted by abortion foes, as our own.
Because what the Republicans have made clear in the weeks since they
took over the House is that there is most certainly morality at play
here, there are most certainly lives at stake: the lives and the moral
value not of the unborn, but of the living, breathing women of this
nation. Related Links:

BLOG: Reduce Climate Change and Taxes Through Family Planning Date:
Tuesday, February 22, 2011
Source: Huffington Post
Author: Mary Ellen Harte and John Harte

There are some universal goals that every US citizen can agree on:
less environmental pollution, less catastrophic weather resulting from
climate change, a better future for our children. Many people would
also like to have lower taxes and smaller government. An important way
for us to achieve ALL these goals is through bringing our populations
to sustainable levels humanely.

How do taxes and population size connect? One of the insidious effects
of population growth is that we create a much greater increase in
needs and problems than the proportional increase in population itself
-- numbers do matter. Try this simple exercise: draw 3 dots, then
connect them in every possible way. Three lines, right? But with 5
dots, you need not 5, but 8 lines. When those lines represent routes
for transportation, communication, and epidemic disease vectors, for
example, or the breakup of ecosystems that supply clean water and air,
suddenly the much larger impact of a bigger population becomes clear.
To address all these added needs and problems, governments need to get
bigger and need much more money -- read taxes.

Unsustainable growth exacerbates the situation. Many demographic
experts now believe that we passed our globally sustainable population
level around the 1970s. According to the 2010 Living Planet Report, we
now use about 1.5 of the planet's renewable resources yearly to
survive and grow. Let's say there are 4 people living in the only
universe they know, a finite space just big enough for them and 10
magic baskets that refill daily, providing them with everything they
need -- food, water, clothing, etc. If this symbolic population
increases to 5, either a person or basket must go to provide room. At
this point, we're chucking out the baskets, in the form of arable
land, clean water, wild foodstocks, and optimum climate. More people,
less resources -- a potent combination for fueling higher taxes, riots
and resource wars, and we're seeing it all right now across the globe.

Nigeria; A Woman's Death at Childbirth Too Gory Date: Saturday,
February 19, 2011
Source: Daily Independent (Lagos)

Writing this piece is very painful for me. I am writing this with a
very heavy heart. This is because as I write, Mariam Jacobs, wife of
one of our graphic artists, Michael, is lying in the Lagos University
Teaching Hospital, (LUTH) morgue .

While we were producing this page last weekend, neither Mariam herself
nor Mike or even anyone in the office had the premonition that Mariam,
who had just survived the trauma of child delivery a few days before,
would be dead by last Monday.

Barely two weeks after giving life to her second child, Mariam took
her last breath and unfortunately, on Valentine's Day.

On a day many lovers were out celebrating love, Mariam was at the
hospital's intensive care unit struggling to live; a struggle that
began with the joy of pregnancy but ended at the cost of her life.

Now, Mariam has just been added to the statistics of women casualty
who died giving birth to another life.

The ongoing doctors' strike across the country has no doubt added to
the rise in maternal mortality that stakeholders have tried to reduce
over years of intervention resulting in the promises of the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs).

Registering and attending regular antenatal clinics have been
attributed as one of the preventive measures of deaths in pregnancy
because it would afford every pregnancy the needed care by experts.

But many women have been known to lose their lives even after
registering and attendance at the government clinic due to inability
to deliver at these centres each time there is a strike.

For instance while Mariam was battling to live, another colleague,
Funmi Falobi, who had registered at the new Lagos State Mother and
Child Hospital, Ifako-Ijaiye, fell into labour the same day and was
promptly taken to the hospital only to be turned back because doctors
and nurses were on strike.

But for God, who delivered her in the car before help could reach her
from a nearby private hospital where she had never been, the story
could have also been different.

>From the available statistics of the United Nations Populations Fund (UNFP=
A) "Across the world every minute a woman dies of complications in pregnanc=
y and childbirth, leaving her baby more likely to also die within two years=
".

According to former Executive Director of UNFPA, Thoraya Ahmed Obaid,
"every day, some 1,400 children will lose their mothers -- one every
minute.

"In every generation, ten million mothers die, leaving ten million
families bereft. Nearly all of these women die in Africa, or Asia, or
in the poorest countries of Latin America. Many die giving birth or
shortly after -- and everyone is the poorer for it," wrote Obaid in a
speech to mark 2009 Mothers' Day.

According to the World Health Organisation, "Maternal death is the
death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of
pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy,
from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its
management but not from accidental or incidental causes.

To ensure this is well understood, the body further explained,
"Pregnancy-related death is defined as the death of a woman while
pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective
of the cause of death".

It identified the major direct causes of maternal deaths and injuries
include haemorrhage (bleeding), infection, high blood pressure, unsafe
abortion, and obstructed labour (prolonged labour).

It is evident that in the United States for instance, "dying in
childbirth" occurs rarely. But for women in most poor countries,
pregnancy and childbirth are the leading causes of death and
disability.

In Africa, one woman in every 26, risks dying of maternal causes,
compared to 1 in 4,800 in the United States.

According to the 2010 Save the Children's annual State of the World's
Mothers Report (SOTWM), the biggest difference between life and death
for a mother is a knowledgeable female health worker to be present at
the birth (not all women are allowed to be seen by a male other than
their husbands; if there is only a male doctor, their birth can go
unattended.)

The SOTWM Report equally found that the best place to be a mother in
the world is in Norway and Australia while the worst country in which
to be a mother is in Afghanistan.

Among the top 10 best places to be a mother: Norway ranks first,
followed by Australia, Iceland, Sweden, Denmark, New Zealand, Finland,
the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany. Among the bottom 10 places:
Afghanistan ranks last, preceded by Niger, Chad, Guinea-Bissau, Yemen,
Democratic Republic of Congo, Mali, Sudan, Eritrea and Equatorial
Guinea.

The United States places 28, down from 27 in 2009, primarily because
its rate for maternal mortality - 1 in 4,800 - is one of the highest
in the developed world. The U.S. also ranks behind many other wealthy
nations in terms of the generosity of maternity leave policies.

>From the 2008 Nigerian Demographic Health Survey (NDHS), 545 (a drop from =
previous 1000) women out of every 100,000 women that get pregnant would los=
e their lives in pregnancy for so many preventable reasons ranging from lac=
k of proper antenatal care, pregnancy-related complications, unsafe abortio=
n, infections during delivery, injuries among many others.

We are so used to the idea that mothers are strong, resourceful and
ever-present that we forget that mothers need protection to prevent
conditions that make them vulnerable to deaths and injury and also
from violence.

Pregnancy is definitely not a disease condition but a condition that
could lead to disability or death if not well managed.

This explains why it has become pertinent that all stakeholders must
do whatever they can to avoid and prevent needless deaths of women
especially in pregnancy. It is not enough to put measures on paper
when it is not valued by all including government and medical workers
who have vowed and pledged to uphold life and dignity above selfish
interests.

In actual fact no man or woman or child should watch a woman die
giving birth to life!

BLOG: House GOP spending cuts will devastate women, families and
economy Date: Tuesday, February 22, 2011
Source: The Hill
Author: Nancy Duff Campbell

House Republican leaders have released their plan for funding?or
defunding?the federal government for the remainder of fiscal year
2011, and their draconian cuts are devastating to women and girls at
every stage of their lives. The same House Republican leaders who
voted to extend lavish tax breaks for the very wealthiest are now
insisting that those who can least afford it sacrifice the most.

If the House passes H.R.1, the Full-Year Continuing Appropriations
Act, girls and women would bear a heavy burden?from girls in early
childhood programs to women in their working and childbearing years to
women in retirement.

For more than forty years, for example, the Title X program has
provided family planning services, breast and cervical cancer
screenings, and other preventive health care to low-income women. But
H.R. 1 eliminates the Title X program, abandoning the more than five
million low-income women and men who are served each year by Title
X-funded health centers. It also eliminates funding for teen pregnancy
prevention, creating yet another barrier for young women in need of
resources to help them make responsible decisions about their health
and their lives. Related Links:

Michele vs. Michelle: Breastfeeding Wars Rise to the Top Date: Monday,
February 21, 2011
Source: RHRealityCheck.org
Author: Amie Newman

You may have taken a break from the news about Wisconsin, Egypt and
the budget battles to read about the fabricated "debate" over
breastfeeding supplies. I write "fabricated" because Rep. Michele
Bachmann has created an argument over First Lady Michelle Obama's
decision to support tax breaks for breast pumps for mothers. From
Politico:

Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann ripped Michelle Obama on Tuesday,
speculating that the first lady might one day run for office, and
accusing her of trying to implement a ?nanny state? based on her
newest push to get mothers to breastfeed their children in order to
help combat childhood obesity.

Bachmann wrongly states, on last Tuesday's Laura Ingraham radio
program, that the federal government would be paying for breast pumps
and related supplies for mothers who need to pump, either because they
are working (and, by the way, pay their own taxes) or because they are
home with their babies, maybe on maternity leave (if they are lucky
enough to get family leave), and have decided that breastfeeding is
the best option for them and their babies. But Bachmann continues to
spew misinformation and rhetoric in place of truth,

Bachmann continued, ?...To think that government has to go out and buy
my breast pump for my babies. You wanna talk about the nanny state? I
think we just got the new definition of a nanny.?

After all, tax deductions for acne cream and denture adhesive are
allowable but since those aren't politically expedient, I suppose
Bachmann is less concerned. Originally, breast pumps and nursing
supplies did not qualify for tax breaks or deductions. In fact, after
extensive complaint and feedback from advocacy groups, health groups,
individuals, and President Obama himself, the IRS changed its policy
to allow families to use their own pre-tax dollars, through their
flexible spending account, to cover breast pumps or to be able to
deduct the cost of breastfeeding supplies from their taxes.

Doctors calling for better sex education to cut pregnancies Date:
Tuesday, February 22, 2011
Source: The Western Mail (Wales)
Author: Madeleine Brindley

A LEADING doctor has questioned the quality and availability of sex
education in Welsh schools.

Dr Richard Lewis, Welsh secretary of the British Medical Association
believes the nation's high teen pregnancy is evidence that it is
failing young people.

A declaration calling for all school children to have sex and
relationship education has been developed and signed by leading health
professionals. It also calls for all young people to have access to
services at teenager-friendly GP surgeries or sexual health clinics.

It comes as figures show the conception rate in 2008 in Wales - the
latest figures available - was 44.3 per thousand girls under 18.

Teen pregnancy rates were highest in Merthyr Tydfil and lowest in
Ceredigion. The figures also show 57% of under 16s who became pregnant
in 2008 had an abortion.

In the same year, cases of the sexually-transmitted infection
chlamydia hit a new high in Wales - infection rates were highest among
the 15 to 24 age group.

Dr Lewis said: "There are a number of things that we can do to help
and guide youths, and there are excellent initiatives operating in
some areas of Wales, but it is vital that the provision is consistent,
and that best practice is shared.

"We need to ensure young people have access to adequate and
appropriate contraception, better and more easily accessible
contraceptive services need to be available via sexual health clinics
in all schools.

"As a nation we must work together to educate and inform young people
of the risks of becoming sexually active too early. It's not just a
job for the classroom, but one for the home as well."

He said an Estyn report in 2007 revealed wide variations in the
quality and impact of sex and relationships education in Wales.

And Dr Lewis contrasted Wales' high teen pregnancy rate with that of
Denmark and Holland, claiming this was a reflection of the sex
education available in these mainland European countries.

Dr Jim Richardson, a member of the Royal College of Nursing's Welsh
Board, who specialises in children and young people, said: "Sex
education is best described as patchy - in some areas it's done very
well and is planned and executed in a strategic way but in other
places it's not so well developed.

"It is fundamentally important to young people's wellbeing that they
have these services and it's not just about pregnancy but also
sexually transmitted infections, which have a very high prevalence
here.

"School nurses are in a key position to deliver on this agenda because
they have the knowledge and skills to address sexual health and other
areas like self esteem and assertiveness.

If we can get this right in youth, it improves people's lifetime
health and wellbeing immeasurably."

An Welsh Assembly Government spokesperson said: "Sex and relationship
education is an important part of growing up.

"The focus of our sexual health action plan to reduce teenage
pregnancies and improve sexual health highlights the importance of
prevention, education, individual responsibility, and access to
healthcare services, when required.

"Our revised personal and social education framework, which has been
introduced in schools and colleges, also aims to develop self-esteem
and self-awareness, while empowering young people to explore the many
aspects of sexuality and healthy personal relationships."

Sarah Palin slams Michelle Obama over nursing Date: Thursday, February 17, =
2011
Source: The Politico
Author: AMIE PARNES

Sarah Palin followed in Rep. Michele Bachmann?s footsteps and took a
swipe at Michelle Obama on Thursday, mocking her efforts to get
mothers to breast-feed their children.

?No wonder Michelle Obama is telling everybody, ?You?d better
breast-feed your baby,? she said at a Long Island appearance on
Thursday, after slamming President Barack Obama for rising gas prices
and other items ? like milk ? since he took office. ?Yeah, you?d
better, because the price of milk is so high right now.?

The comments come two days after Bachmann accused the first lady of
trying to implement a ?nanny state.?

?To think that government has to go out and buy my breast pump for my
babies? You wanna talk about the nanny state, I think you just got a
new definition.?

Bachmann, a Minnesota Republican and tea party favorite, added that
the first lady?s agenda is ??very consistent with where the hard left
is coming from.?

Women and Gender; Women's Role in Science Under Spotlight Date:
Monday, February 21, 2011
Source: BuaNews (Tshwane)

Access and the participation of women and girls in the field of
science and technology will be the focus of this year's United Nations
Commission on the Status of Women (CSW).

During the CSW, which will kick off in New York on Tuesday, countries
around the world, including South Africa, will need to answer a
question on whether there has been any improvement in increasing the
number of girls and women in the field of science and technology.

The CSW will focus on access and participation of women and girls in
education, training, science and technology, including the promotion
of women's equal access to full employment and decent work.

Minister for Women, Children and People with Disabilities Lulu
Xingwana, supported by Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini,
will lead a South African delegation to the annual meeting.

At the plenary session, Xingwana will present a statement outlining
progress and challenges in increasing access and participation of
women in the field of natural sciences, engineering, mathematics and
information technology in South Africa.

South Africa will also on Wednesday hold a special session to present
the country's initiative aimed at providing girls with access to the
world of work to enable them to take up scarce careers required by the
economy.

The initiative termed Techno Girls is supported by UNICEF and
currently implemented in KwaZulu-Natal, Limpopo and Western Cape. The
programme, which maintains an exclusive focus on careers in the fields
of Maths, Science and Technology, recruits about 4 000 girls currently
studying Mathematics and Science at Grades 9 to12.

In addition to the main theme of science and technology, the CSW will
also attend to the global challenge of violence against women and
children, where South Africa will showcase its Thuthuzela programme,
which provides integrated services to survivors of sexual violence
under the leadership of the National Prosecuting Authority.

Progress made in establishing Family Violence, Child Protection and
Sexual Offences units within the Police Service will also be
presented.

At the invitation of the UNAIDS Executive Director, Michel Sidibe,
Xingwana will on Thursday participate in a high-level consultation on
measures to be taken to reduce vulnerability of women and girls to HIV
and promote sexual and reproductive health rights.

Due to gender inequality, women continue to be disproportionately
infected and affected by HIV and Aids. South Africa will showcase the
progress it is making in reducing the spread of HIV infection and in
implementing the biggest Aids treatment programme in the world.
