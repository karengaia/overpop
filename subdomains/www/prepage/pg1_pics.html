<p>A health care worker in Bangladesh gives a young pregnant woman a birthing kit for a safer delivery. It contains a sterile razor to cut the cord, a sterile plastic sheet to place under the birth area, and other simple, sanitary items - all which help save lives. The health care worker asks the young woman to come back with her baby for a post natal check after the birth. At that time, she asks the mom if she wants to have another child right away or if she wants to space her children. Usually the mom wants to wait, and gladly accepts contraception. The worker is prepared to give her pills, an injection, implants, or an IUD. The mother is instructed to come back if the baby shows signs of diarrhea or pneumonia, common infant killers.

50 years ago, here in the USA, I was given the same option to space my births after the birth of my first baby. I gladly accepted contraceptive pills (which was new to me) .. Karen Gaia</p></span></a>

<p>Many areas of the world do not get enough water to support their inhabitants. This is a typical watering place in Ethiopia where, in many places, water for basic needs must be carried many miles. Taking the time necessary to get water and firewood often leaves little time for attending school or earning a living. If populations continue to grow in these areas, there will be less water per person and a lower chance at survival. Often people are forced to move from these lands into the city or to another country in order to survive.</p></span></a>

<p><acronym title="Mother, Caring for 7 Billion. .. It is a story of women from patriarchal societies standing up against tradition and gaining control of their fertility, and of women in this country making family planning decisions based on a worldview that escapes the religious pressures of their mothers. 
	It addressed the problems of overpopulation in terms that were plain, human and understandable. ... Incredible film ... I was touched beyond words. What a powerful film and hope to see it in more theatres on this planet. 
	 I've always known that this is important issue and instinctually feel that this issue should be broadcast louder!! Educate the uniformed and schools in the country! Time to Wake Up and do something!
Show this important film! Our group has shown it over 20 times! Go to motherthefilm.com for information. .. Karen Gaia">
