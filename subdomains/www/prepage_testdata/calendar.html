<a class="tooltip" href="#">January 19 - <b>Martin Luther King Day</b>
<span>"There is no human circumstance more tragic than the persisting existence of a harmful condition for which a remedy is readily available. Family planning, to relate population to world resources, is possible, practical and necessary. 
<br><br>
Unlike plagues of the dark ages or contemporary diseases we do not yet understand, the modern plague of overpopulation is soluble by means we have discovered and with resources we possess.
<br><br>
"What is lacking is not sufficient knowledge of the solution but universal consciousness of the gravity of the problem and education of the billions who are its victims. ... <i>Martin Luther King, Jr</i>"</span></a></p>

January 22  - <a class="tooltip" href="http://www.SinceRoe.com"><b>Roe vs. Wade anniversary</b><span>39 years ago the courts recognized the right of women to make personal, private medical decisions, to control their bodies, their reproductive health, and their lives.
<br><br> 
Planned Parenthood has set up a website -  www.SinceRoe.com - to show the world exactly what Roe has meant in the past and still means today. We've got a lot to fight for, and a lot to lose. Please, take a look and share it far and wide. Even better, add your own comment about how Roe v. Wade has made a difference in your life.
<br><br>
Despite the broad, mainstream support for upholding Roe, some politicians are as determined as ever to overturn it and strip women of the rights we've held for nearly 40 years.</span></a></p>
